<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Doublade often dwells in the shadow of its Ubers evolution Aegislash, but it manages to find a nice spot in the UU tier as an extremely bulky Eviolite tank. Doublade's fantastic Steel / Ghost typing gives it nine resistances and three immunities. A solid base 110 Attack along with a base 150 Defense allow it to tank hits with ease and retaliate with a strong attack of its own. When holding an Eviolite, its Defense skyrockets to insane levels, letting it shrug off even super effective hits. Doublade also resists Stealth Rock, is immune to Toxic Spikes, and actually enjoys switching into Sticky Web because it increases Gyro Ball's Base Power. In addition to all this, Doublade's low base 35 Speed makes it a very potent sweeper on Trick Room teams when combined with the perfect neutral coverage it gets from Shadow Sneak / Shadow Claw and Sacred Sword.</p>

<p>While Doublade's physical bulk is phenomenal, its HP and Special Defense are horrendous. Even with an Eviolite, it has trouble checking most special attackers. No Guard also hampers Doublade more than it helps, as common coverage moves like Fire Blast will always hit it. Doublade is also extremely slow outside of Trick Room, forcing it to take a hit before attacking, which can wear it down easily. Doublade has no means of reliable recovery; holding Leftovers means giving up Eviolite, which is mandatory for checking some dangerous threats. The buff to Knock Off also severely reduces Doublade's ability to check the Fighting-types that often carry it.</p>

<h1>Swords Dance Tank</h1>

<div class=set>
    Doublade @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: No Guard<br>
    EVs: 240 HP / 252 Atk / 16 SpD<br>
    Brave Nature<br>
    - Swords Dance<br>- Gyro Ball<br>- Sacred Sword<br>- Shadow Sneak
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Doublade generally gets multiple opportunities to use Swords Dance, as it forces many physical attackers out and can take hits relatively well. Gyro Ball is Doublade's main STAB move, as it hits very hard when factoring in its low Speed and high Attack. Sacred Sword provides valuable coverage against the Steel- and Dark-types that resist Gyro Ball. Shadow Sneak gives Doublade a way to finish off weakened opponents and rounds off Doublade's perfect neutral coverage with a STAB priority move. Some alternative moves can be used, such as Rock Slide to dent Flying-types and common Fire-types on the switch, Shadow Claw for the extra power, or Aerial Ace to take care of Fighting-types that will switch in to try and use Knock Off.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>240 HP EVs gives Doublade a Stealth Rock number while minimizing burn damage. 252 EVs in Attack are used to maximize Doublade's offensive capabilities. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense since Speed is actually detrimental, and Doublade's Defense is already insanely high. A Brave nature is used to boost Doublade's Attack while lowering its Speed to power up Gyro Ball. Eviolite is mandatory, turning Doublade into a physical juggernaut. No Guard is the only ability available to Doublade. 0 Speed IVs further increase Gyro Ball's power.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Doublade can switch in on most physical attacks, even weaker super effective ones. However, keep it away from special attackers, as even resisted hits can put dents in it. Doublade also loathes Knock Off, which hits it super effectively and removes its precious Eviolite. Scout for potential coverage moves on opponents, such as Earthquake, Shadow Ball, and the aforementioned Knock Off. In addition to this, scout for mixed sets on offensive Pokemon such as Sharpedo and Hydreigon.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Doublade desperately needs a special wall to alleviate its lack of Special Defense; examples include Assault Vest Meloetta (which can also apply offensive pressure), specially defensive Porygon2, Florges, and Umbreon. Doublade also lacks any form of recovery, so Wish passers such as Aromatisse, Florges, Alomomola, and Umbreon make great teammates, prolonging Doublade's time on the field. Doublade appreciates status absorbers or Fire-types to switch into Will-O-Wisps, as a burn will severely limit both its offensive and defensive capabilities. Flying-types or Levitate users, especially ones that resist Fire-type moves, such as Flygon, Rotom-H, and Aerodactyl make great teammates. Bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon, Suicune, and Swampert can take Fire- and Ground-type moves aimed at Doublade and threaten back with a STAB move. Pokemon that can set up Trick Room give Doublade an opportunity to sweep by 'outspeeding' most Pokemon under Trick Room. Hydreigon is possibly Doublade's best teammate, as the pair resist each other's weaknesses while hitting from both the physical and special sides.</p>

<h1>RestTalk</h1>

<div class=set>
    Doublade @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: No Guard<br>
    EVs: 240 HP / 252 Def / 16 SpD<br>
    Relaxed Nature<br>
    - Rest<br>- Sleep Talk<br>- Shadow Claw / Sacred Sword<br>- Gyro Ball / Toxic
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Rest and Sleep Talk allow Doublade to rid itself of status afflictions and recover its HP completely, while not being totally useless when asleep. Shadow Claw is preferred over Shadow Sneak as Sleep Talk still has normal priority, but Shadow Sneak can be used while awake for priority. Sacred Sword can also be used, as it hits more targets super effectively. Gyro Ball is still Doublade's strongest STAB move due to its low Speed and high Attack. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to rack up residual damage on switch-ins and stall out some Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>240 EVs in HP reduce entry hazard and burn damage. 252 EVs in Defense allow Doublade to take literally any physical attack. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense to try and give Doublade a little more bulk on the special side. A Relaxed nature boosts its Defense while lowering its Speed, powering up Gyro Ball. Eviolite boosts Doublade's Defense up to insane levels while somewhat patching up its lackluster Special Defense. 0 Speed IVs power up Gyro Ball and allow Doublade to 'outspeed' most Pokemon under Trick Room.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Trick Room is helpful, as a lucky critical hit could mean the difference between getting off a Rest or dying. It's also useful since Doublade runs 0 Speed IVs and usually needs to take a hit before being able to move. Keep in mind that the Fighting-types that Doublade can usually check now often carry Knock Off, which can cripple it by removing its Eviolite. Even with the increased bulk, you should still scout for mixed sets, super effective coverage moves, and special attackers in general that can still muscle past this set provided they are not weak to one of Doublade's attacks.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Similar to the Swords Dance Tank set, this physically inclined set still appreciates specially defensive walls such as Assault Vest Meloetta (which can also apply offensive pressure), specially defensive Porygon2, Florges, and Umbreon. Wish passers are no longer as necessary due to RestTalk, but they still helpful during situations where Doublade is asleep with a low amount of health. Water-types, Flying-types, and Levitate users make great teammates, as they resist Doublade's common weaknesses. Trick Room setters are useful, allowing Doublade to move first and stall much better. Again, Hydreigon is a fantastic teammate, as the two resist each other's weaknesses, forming a solid core.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Doublade has a fairly limited movepool, but it generally has the tools to do its job well. A SubToxic set can be used to some effect, but the prevalence of special attackers and phazers discourages its use. Pursuit can be used to trap fleeing Pokemon as they switch out, but Doublade usually does not have enough moveslots to accommodate it.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Literally every special attacker in the tier can force Doubalde out due to its subpar special bulk and low HP.</p>

<p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Will-O-Wisp will always hit thanks to No Guard, and burn halves Doublade's Attack and slowly wears it down unless it is running RestTalk.</p>

<p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off cripples Doublade by removing its Eviolite and hits it for super effective damage.</p>

<p><strong>Trick / Switcheroo</strong>: Trick and Switcheroo also remove Doublade's Eviolite while potentially crippling it with an unwanted item.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Houndoom</strong>: Mega Houndoom hits Doublade super effectively on its weaker special side with both of its STABs. It cannot switch in directly due to the risk of Doublade carrying Sacred Sword, but once it switches in safely, there is almost nothing Doublade can do against it.</p>

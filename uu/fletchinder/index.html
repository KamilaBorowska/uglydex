<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Fletchinder is pretty limited in what it can do, but it is very unique with what it does in the UU tier. With priority Acrobatics, the strongest priority in the tier, and access to Swords Dance, Fletchinder makes for an excellent revenge killer and late-game cleaner. That being said, Fletchinder is extremely frail and 4x weak to Stealth Rock, which makes it a bit tricky to use.</p>

    - Acrobatics<br>- Swords Dance<br>- Roost<br>- Will-O-Wisp
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Fletchinder has a very shallow and predictable movepool and has to rely on Acrobatics for damage. Thankfully, it has access to Swords Dance, which helps to improve its damage output, as well as having support moves such as Roost and Will-O-Wisp, which allow Fletchinder to stay around longer despite its poor defenses and 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Will-O-Wisp also helps get chip damage on some of Fletchinder's checks.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>In order to do as much damage as possible, Fletchinder needs an Adamant nature with 252 EVs. With priority Flying-type moves due to Gale Wings, Fletchinder doesn't need to run too much Speed, but 152 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed and burn foes such as Adamant Honchkrow. The remaining EVs go into HP to provide some more bulk. Because its only attacking move is Acrobatics, Fletchinder runs no item in order to maximize the damage output of Acrobatics. An EV spread tweak can be made to make Fletchinder take resisted hits better by giving it 248 HP EVs and dropping the Speed EVs.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Fletchinder isn't a Pokemon that can sweep on its own. To use this Pokemon effectively, you should be eliminating its counters throughout the game and keeping it healthy for the late-game. Despite being frail, it will usually have an opportunity to set up a Swords Dance, which will allow it to deal heavy damage to anything that isn't a check. Outside of being a late-game cleaner, Fletchinder can be useful throughout a match by revenge killing fast, weakened Pokemon with a priority Acrobatics.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>With average initial Attack and only Acrobatics and Will-O-Wisp to inflict damage, Fletchinder needs some team support. Powerful Choice Band users such as Heracross and Krookodile can significantly weaken dedicated physical walls such as Hippowdon and Swampert, which normally switch into Fletchinder. Pokemon that can take out bulky Water-types, such as Shaymin, Whimsicott, Heliolisk, and Toxicroak, really aid Fletchinder in sweeping. With a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, Fletchinder likes entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Forretress, Empoleon, Tentacruel, and Mega Blastoise. Also, any Pokemon that benefits from having Fighting-types eliminated, such as Hydreigon or Snorlax, is a great teammate for Fletchinder.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Fletchinder can run Overheat to hit Mega Aggron and Forretress for super effective damage. U-turn can also be used to keep some momentum from the switches Fletchinder will force against Fighting-types. As a last-ditch effort, Fletchinder can use Tailwind to ensure the rest of its team will have a Speed boost for a few turns. Finally, Taunt can also be utilized to stallbreak better.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune take minimal damage from Acrobatics and can retaliate with a super effective Scald.</p>

<p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Mega Ampharos and Rotom-H resist Acrobatics and can OHKO Fletchinder back with Electric-type STAB moves.</p>

<p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Fletchinder's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock really discourages it from switching in when the entry hazard is on the field.</p>

<p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: While they don't appreciate being burned, Rock-types such as Mega Aerodactyl and Rhyperior resist Acrobatics and can retaliate with a 4x super effective Rock-type move.</p>

<p><strong>Dedicated Physical Walls</strong>: Dedicated physical walls such as Porygon2 and Hippowdon can eat up a hit and use Toxic or attack Fletchinder.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Priority Users</strong>: Faster priority users such as Entei and Lucario can revenge kill Fletchinder after a bit of prior damage.</p>

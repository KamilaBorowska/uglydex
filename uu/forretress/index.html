<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Forretress benefits from great 140 Defense that lets it serve as the mainstream physical sponge to the majority of the tier and it also has access to Rapid Spin. It also comes with two handy abilities: Sturdy ensures that Forretress will survive any one hit while Overcoat protects it from powder moves and hail damage. Forretress's main role is to serve as an entry hazard stacker and spinner. Having access to Volt Switch also allows Forretress to serve as a slow defensive pivot that helps retain momentum. Forretress's usable base 90 Attack allows for a decent-hitting Gyro Ball, letting it to take on some fast and frail threats. Unfortunately, poor attacking options make it setup bait, and its poor base 60 Special Defense does not aid in helping Forretress do its main jobs.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>First and foremost, Forretress's job is to use Rapid Spin and keep entry hazards off your side of the field. The choice of entry hazard is team-dependent; if another Pokemon has Stealth Rock, you should run Spikes and set up dual entry hazards. Volt Switch turns Forretress into a defensive pivot by retaining momentum against switch-ins. The choice between Gyro Ball and Toxic is preference; Gyro Ball lets Forretress take on fast Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mienshao, Alakazam, Crobat, and Whimsicott, while Toxic cripples most of Forretress's common switch-ins, including Swampert and Vaporeon.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Leftovers ensures longevity and passive recovery. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Forretress to maximize its defensive bulk. An alternate spread of 244 SpD EVs allows Forretress to switch in against a few extra specially bulky Pokemon such as Swampert, Florges, and Vaporeon and make entry hazard stacking or spinning a little easier. An Attack-lowering nature and 0 Attack IVs help against Foul Play, while a Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs should be used if one opts for Gyro Ball. Sturdy guarantees that Forretress will be able to use Rapid Spin or Volt Switch or set up entry hazards, assuming it is at full HP. Alternatively, Overcoat allows Forretress to work around threats such as Roserade and other powder users.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Try to avoid using Forretress as a lead. Instead, use it to take hits from a variety of strong physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Mienshao. As a defensive pivot, it benefits from Wish support to help utilize its "sponge and switch" tactics. Once you've done your job with Forretress, it is okay to use it as death fodder. Forretress does not work with every team; a defensive pivot with spinning capabilities is not particularly useful on hyper offense. Normally, you'll want to run Forretress on balanced teams that can provide a synergistic relationship between spinning and Wish support. This set's Toxic allows you to apply pressure to Hippowdon, Donphan, and Swampert. Essentially, Forretress applies Toxic pressure on almost any Pokemon that chooses to switch in expecting entry hazards. Most notably, Baton Pass Vaporeon and Swampert hate being Toxic poisoned.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>This set works extremely well with bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon or Suicune, and it appreciates additional utility support from pivots such as Gligar or Crobat. Slow Volt Switch works well with wallbreakers and stallbreakers, such as Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Hydreigon. Forretress works well with fast Taunt users that can help prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up entry hazards. It also appreciates Pokemon such as Krookodile that can take care of spinblockers. Forretress is perfectly suited for balanced teams, well-suited for bulky offense, and decently suited on semistall teams.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Toxic Spikes is a rarely used option due to the plethora of Defog users and Poison-types; however, it is still an option if one opts to use it. An alternate spread of 80 or 120 Attack EVs can be used for harder hitting Gyro Balls on the defensive set. One can opt to use Earthquake in order to hit Fire-types on the switch. Counter can also be utilized with Sturdy on the defensive spread in order to better take on Haxorus, Machamp, and other bulky physical attackers; however, Gyro Ball is generally the superior option against Mega Aerodactyl and frail attackers.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong> Forretress hates Scald users, notably defog Empoleon, but will be able to do its job with the right support.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong> All Fire-types, notably Chandelure, Entei, and Arcanine, give Forretress trouble. Pokemon such as Noivern or Hydreigon, that have access to common Fire-type moves, also cause grief for Forretress.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt Users</strong> Taunt users shut Forretress down, as they prevent it from setting up entry hazards.</p>

<p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong> Suicune and most bulky setup sweepers, as well as Substitute + Calm Mind users such as Raikou and Jirachi, will be able to set up on Forretress.</p>

<p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong> Espeon or Xatu bounce back Forretress's entry hazards.</p>

<p><strong>Trick Users</strong> Forretress needs to anticipate Choiced Trick users, such as Jirachi, that like to cripple it.</p>

<p><strong>Spinblockers</strong> Though UU doesn't have a plethora of Ghost-types to choose from, the occasional Jellicent and the common switch-in Chandelure will pose a problem for Forretress.</p>

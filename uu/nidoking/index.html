<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Nidoking is one of the foremost special wallbreakers of the UnderUsed tier, able to OHKO many frail threats that don't resist its moves with the help of Stealth Rock and 2HKO a huge portion of the metagame bar special sponges such as Blissey, Umbreon, Vaporeon, Cresselia, Porygon2, and Rotom-H. Unfortunately, Nidoking hits a poor Speed tier, making it easily revenge killed. Nidoking also faces stiff competition from its bulkier counterpart, Nidoqueen, which hits harder with a Modest nature; however, Nidoking is not to be underestimated, as it is not frail enough to be taken down by any resisted move, and it can dish out serious damage in return.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Sludge Wave is Nidoking's go-to STAB move, 2HKOing Florges and provides the most base damage out of all of Nidoking's moves. Earth Power is Nidoking's secondary STAB move and is useful against Steel-types and Pokemon that resist Poison. Ice Beam is for Flying-types, such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, that either resist or are immune to Nidoking's other moves. Superpower hits Umbreon and Blissey for super effective damage, which is useful as a late-game surprise tactic, while Stealth Rock allows Nidoking to surprise the opponent by opting to apply passive pressure instead of offensive pressure. Stealth Rock also helps Nidoking in cleaning up late-game.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>252 Special Attack EVs are used to help Nidoking wallbreak as easily as possible. 252 Speed EVs allow Nidoking to Speed tie with many prominent offensive Pokemon, such as Heracross, and outspeed slower Pokemon such as Nidoqueen. A Modest nature can be used to hit harder than Nidoqueen, gaining more guaranteed 2HKOs on bulky Water-type switch-ins such as Suicune. Life Orb works perfectly with Sheer Force and Nidoking's moveset, negating any recoil for a 69% power boost to Nidoking's special moves.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Nidoking is best used as a special wallbreaker or lure for special walls, as Blissey loves to tackle Nidoking head-on. Prediction will often be the biggest problem when facing balance cores that can work around Nidoking's attacks. As a result, it is often best to rely on teammates to play around the opponent's team; Nidoking should be wallbreaking, not psyching out the opponent.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Rotom-H, Forretress, and Gligar can absorb physical hits and get Nidoking in safely against many physical wallbreakers. Entry hazard users work well with Nidoking's special wallbreaking potential. Nidoking is prone to being revenge killed, so bulky team support is a must. Some setup sweepers such as Cresselia appreciate Nidoking's ability to take care of phazers such as Empoleon and attackers or Taunters such as Crobat. However, Nidoking needs to be careful about switching into these Pokemon, which is why Pokemon such as Vaporeon or Umbreon are excellent teammates, Baton Passing to Nidoking to get it safely past bulky Water-types. Lastly, physical wallbreakers such as Mienshao, Heracross, and Entei really appreciate Nidoking's ability to lure special walls.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Megahorn, and Sucker Punch are all acceptable options for Nidoking, depending on the needs of your team. A Choice Scarf set can be used with a Timid nature and a fourth attacking move, preferably Thunderbolt. Toxic Spikes can also be used in order to apply more defensive pressure, although Nidoqueen does uses the move better.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Dedicated Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Vaporeon and Cresselia can switch into Nidoking's moves, though others such as Blissey and Umbreon must be wary of switching into Superpower.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Attackers</strong>: Entei, Darmanitan, Haxorus, Hydreigon, and +1 setup sweepers such as Salamence can outspeed and OHKO Nidoking.</p>

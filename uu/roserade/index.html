<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Roserade was one of the most influential Pokemon in BW UU, and she returns to wreak havoc in the tier. Roserade is pretty versatile and has great Special Attack, good Special Defense, and decent Speed, as well as a good offensive and supportive movepool, allowing her to take an offensive or defensive approach according to the needs of its team. Roserade's typing allows her to take on the myriad of Water-types in UU. She also resists the STAB moves of the newly introduced Fairy-types and can hit them back super effectively as well. Due to the new breeding mechanics, she can also now use Sleep Powder and Spikes on the same set.</p>

<p>However, not everything is roses for Roserade. She has pitiful Defense and HP, which means almost every physical attack threatens her. She is weak to Fire-type attacks, which is arguably one of the most common attacking types in the current metagame. Her Speed, although decent, leaves Roserade vulnerable to a lot of faster threats. The buff to Defog makes it harder to keep entry hazards on the field, thus hurting one of its main selling points. The changed sleep mechanics also hit her hard.</p>

<h1>Offensive Spiker</h1>

<div class=set>
    Roserade @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Natural Cure / Technician<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Spikes / Toxic Spikes<br>- Sludge Bomb<br>- Giga Drain / Leaf Storm<br>- Sleep Powder / Rest / Hidden Power Fire
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>This set aims at stacking entry hazards to pressure the opponent. The choice between Spikes and Toxic Spikes depends upon your team's needs. Spikes is better on more offensive teams while Toxic Spikes is better on balanced teams. Sludge Bomb is a powerful STAB move and has no drawbacks, hitting opposing Grass-types who switch into Roserade expecting a Grass-type attack. Giga Drain is a reliable secondary STAB move that also provides recovery. It also hits many spinners super effectively. Leaf Storm is a more powerful alternative and gives Roserade huge wallbreaking capabilities. However, it cuts Roserade's Special Attack in half, forcing her to switch out. However, keep in mind that it is stronger than Giga Drain over two turns. Sleep Powder, although nerfed this generation, still makes switching into Roserade a gamble due to how crippling sleep can be. It can be used on potential spinners or Defoggers to prevent them from removing the entry hazards. Rest in conjunction with Natural Cure provides a full recovery after switching out. Hidden Power Fire in conjunction with Technician allows Roserade to hit Steel-type that resist her STAB moves. It also maims Overcoat Forretress who is immune to Sleep Powder.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EV spread maximizes Roserade's Special Attack and Speed so she can set up entry hazards as fast as possible, while still hitting switch-ins hard. A Timid nature is used to maximize her Speed. The choice of nature depends on the moves used. Natural Cure provides reliable recovery with Rest and also cures Roserade of burns and paralysis. Technician gives a pseudo-STAB boost to Hidden Power Fire. Life Orb gives a much needed power boost to Roserade's attacks. Black Sludge may be used if you want to make her last longer, but the power boost is crucial. 29 HP IVs are used to minimize Life Orb recoil. Note that the number of HP IVs does not affect the Hidden Power type.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Switch Roserade in on resisted moves and set up the entry hazard of your choice on the switch. Don't sacrifice Roserade early-game, as it may be useful later for punching holes or sweeping. Use Sleep Powder carefully, as most good players will not send in their main Roserade answer immediately due to the fear of being crippled, and using it on the wrong Pokemon wastes most of its potential. If the opponent has a spinner or Defogger, try to play conservatively with Roserade, as she can set up entry hazards multiple times. Try to use Sleep Powder or wear down them with teammates and Roserade's own attacks. Don't mindlessly use Leaf Storm if the opponent has a potential setup sweeper such as Mega Houndoom.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Roserade appreciates a Ghost-type teammate as they can prevent a Rapid Spin user from removing the entry hazards she sets. Jellicent is a good option as it can take on Starmie, which is the only spinner that wins against Roserade one on one. Roserade needs teammates who can take care of Fire-type Pokemon. Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Suicune are good teammates for this reason. Rock-type Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Mega Aerodactyl can also take care of many Defoggers, can set up Stealth Rock, and threaten opposing Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon with their respective STAB attacks. Due to her great wallbreaking capabilities, Roserade can allow a teammate to sweep late-game. Pokemon who appreciate the removal of opposing Water-types and Florges such as Hydreigon, Mega Houndoom, and Darmanitan are great teammates. Offensive Pokemon appreciate the entry hazards set up by Roserade to break down walls more easily.</p>

<h1>Specially Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Roserade @ Black Sludge<br>
    Ability: Natural Cure<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 240 SpD / 16 Spe<br>
    Calm Nature<br>
    - Synthesis / Leech Seed<br>- Spikes<br>- Toxic Spikes / Sludge Bomb<br>- Sludge Bomb / Giga Drain
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Synthesis provides reliable recovery, but Leech Seed may be used if your team struggles against Suicune. Spikes gives Roserade a niche over Amoonguss and provides team support by inflicting residual damage. Toxic Spikes is the better option against defensive teams which lack a Poison-type. Sludge Bomb is her most powerful STAB move and prevents Roserade from becoming Taunt bait. Giga Drain can be used if your team has nothing to hit Water-types and also provides a little recovery which may come in handy in a pinch.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EV spread is straightforward. HP and Special Defense are maximized to make Roserade as specially bulky as possible while outspeeding Modest max Speed Empoleon and everything slower. A Calm nature further boosts its Special Defense. Black Sludge provides passive recovery.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This set is best used on stall and balanced teams. Bring Roserade in on special hits and proceed to lay entry hazards. It is not necessary to lay both types, so use Team Preview to decide which one you want to focus on. If the opponent does not have a Poison-type and their team is defensive, lay Toxic Spikes. Otherwise, Spikes is the better option. Try to preserve Roserade if the opponent has a spinner or Defog user. Also, Synthesis should be used conservatively, as it has very low PP. Don't stay in on physical attackers, as Roserade has very bad Defense and sometimes even resisted hits will do quite a lot of damage to her.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Swampert, and Suicune can take care of Fire-types who love to switch into Roserade's Grass-type STAB move. They also have very good synergy with Roserade. Rock-type Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Mega Aerodactyl are also good switch-ins for Fire-types as well as Flying-types, and can hit them in return with their respective Rock-type STAB moves. They can also pressurize most of the Defoggers with their attacks. A physical wall like Slowbro makes a good teammate as Roserade has terrible Defense. A Ghost-type is useful to prevent Rapid Spin users from removing the entry hazards set by Roserade. Sableye and Jellicent work well and have good synergy with Roserade. Sableye can also prevent Defog with Prankster Taunt, although it has to be on the field simultaneously with the Defog user. Raikou can take advantage of the entry hazards as well as pressurizing common Defog users with its STAB attacks.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Weather Ball may be used on a weather-based team for powerful coverage. Choice Scarf turns Roserade into a decent revenge killer, while with Choice Specs, she becomes a fearsome wallbreaker. However, most of Roserade's attacks have some drawbacks such as lowering stats or poor coverage, making it dangerous to be locked into one move. Dazzling Gleam and Extrasensory can be used on the offensive sets, but the other moves hit hard enough most of the time.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Infernape, and Mega Houndoom can switch into Roserade's Grass-type attacks and threaten it with their respective STAB moves. However, they should be wary of switching into Sludge Bomb or Sleep Powder.</p>

<p><strong>Crobat</strong>: Crobat resists both of Roserade's STAB moves and Hidden Power Fire hits it neutrally. It can Taunt Roserade, preventing her from using Sleep Powder, and then use Defog to remove the entry hazards set by Roserade. It can also force her out with its STAB attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Defoggers</strong>: Defoggers can remove entry hazards set up by Roserade, and most of them carry a super effective STAB move. Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat are good examples.</p>

<p><strong>Powerful Physical Attackers</strong>: Powerful physical attackers such as Flygon and Honchkrow can threaten Roserade with their respective STAB attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Umbreon</strong>: Umbreon can take any attack that Roserade throws at it and can 3HKO Roserade in return.</p>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, Cobalion, Escavalier, and Forretress can take on any Roserade not carrying Hidden Power Fire and can either threaten with their attacks, or set up on Roserade. Forretress can even use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards set up by Roserade. However, they should all be wary of Sleep Powder.</p>

<p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Common Choice Scarf users, such as Darmanitan, Hydreigon, and Mienshao can revenge kill Roserade after a little residual damage.</p>

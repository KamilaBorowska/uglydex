<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Galvantula has access to the coveted Sticky Web, which lowers the Speed of grounded foes that switch in by one stage. It also has an above-average base 108 Speed, letting it set up Sticky Web quickly. However, Galvantula has a relatively shallow movepool outside of Sticky Web and is held back by pathetic defenses. Although its base 97 Special Attack gives it some offensive presence, it cannot really hurt most threats not weak to its STAB moves. However, Galvantula does have a niche over Shuckle in that it has a good matchup versus common entry hazard removers such as Empoleon, Blastoise, and Crobat.</p>

<h1>Suicide Lead</h1>

<div class=set>
    Galvantula @ Focus Sash<br>
    Ability: Compound Eyes<br>
    EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Sticky Web<br>- Thunder<br>- Bug Buzz<br>- Thunder Wave / Energy Ball
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Sticky Web is the main reason to use Galvantula, as it provides helpful speed control. Thunder is used over Thunderbolt because Compound Eyes boosts its accuracy to 91%, and Galvantula needs all the power it can get. Bug Buzz is a secondary STAB move that hits Grass- and Ground-types; it also nails Espeon and Mega Absol, which have Magic Bounce to reflect Sticky Web. Thunder Wave allows Galvantula to paralyze setup sweepers trying to set up on it and also has the added benefit of slowing down faster opposing leads. Energy Ball can be used to provide additional coverage, as it hits Swampert and most other Ground-types harder than Bug Buzz does.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Focus Sash is the mandatory item, as it allows Galvantula to survive almost any hit and set up Sticky Web. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature maximize Speed, allowing Galvantula to Speed tie with Infernape, while 252 Special Attack EVs give Galvantula more power behind its attacking moves. Compound Eyes is the ability chosen, as it boosts Thunder's accuracy to 91%.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Galvantula should almost always be used in the lead position, unless the opponent has a faster lead packing Taunt, such as Froslass. Against faster leads without Taunt, first use Thunder Wave, and then take advantage of their lowered Speed by setting up Sticky Web the next turn. Galvantula can deal with Magic Bounce users with Bug Buzz, hitting them super effectively and can also stop setup attempts by using Thunder Wave. After setting up Sticky Web, Galvantula should usually try to cripple the opposing lead with Thunder Wave or simply attack it right away, as it is likely the opponent has set up entry hazards or broken Galvantula's Focus Sash.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Galvantula is best used with teammates that have good power, but are crippled by their average Speed. Pokemon such as Chandelure, Honchkrow, Machamp, and Nidoking fit into this category, and all of them enjoy Sticky Web support. This allows them to use power-boosting items over Choice Scarf, such as Choice Specs in Chandelure's case and Life Orb for Honchkrow and Nidoking. Rapid Spin users such as Starmie and Blastoise are good partners, as they can remove entry hazards on your side of the field without getting rid of Sticky Web. Spinblockers such as Chandelure can block Rapid Spin, which removes Sticky Web. A fast safety net such as Choice Scarf Darmanitan or Raikou can also be helpful if Sticky Web is removed or if opposing Flying-types are problematic. Finally, Taunt users such as Krookodile can be useful to limit Defog users such as Crobat.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Volt Switch can be used to pivot out after setting up Sticky Web; however, most of the time, Galvantula is better off just staying in. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit select targets such as Flygon, Gligar, and Zygarde, but Thunder Wave is more useful in most situations for crippling opponents.</p>

<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users such as Entei can limit Galvantula to using only Sticky Web by bringing it down to its Focus Sash and then finishing it off with a priority attack.</p>

<p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Some Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom-H and Flygon, can outspeed and limit Galvantula to using only Sticky Web while being unaffected by Thunder Wave and not minding its STAB moves.</p>

<p><strong>Electric- and Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Mega Ampharos, and Raikou are immune to Thunder Wave and resist or are immune to Thunder.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Fast Taunt users such as Froslass and Aerodactyl can prevent Galvantula from setting up Sticky Web by outspeeding and Taunting it. </p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Some entry hazard removers, such as Gligar, Flygon, and Assault Vest Donphan, can remove Sticky Web and do not fear Galvantula's attacks.</p>

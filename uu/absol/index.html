<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Mega Absol has fantastic offensive stats and the wide movepool to back it up. Mega Absol has plenty of options offensively, with moves including Knock Off, Sucker Punch, Ice Beam, Fire Blast, Superpower, and Play Rough. It also has access to Swords Dance, boosting its already high Attack to insane levels. Its ability when Mega Evolved, Magic Bounce, further helps its offensive presence, preventing Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp and even Stealth Rock, bouncing them back at the opponent, and it excels at bothering lead Pokemon such as Froslass. However, Mega Absol is immensely frail, struggling to take even neutral hits, making it nearly impossible to switch into attacks. It also has poor Speed before Mega Evolving, meaning it is forced to use Sucker Punch on faster threats.</p>

<h1>Swords Dance</h1>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Absol's Attack to crazy levels and works great in combination with Mega Absol's ability, which bounces back moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Knock Off is a powerful STAB attack that also removes its target's item. Sucker Punch is powerful priority against Pokemon that can outspeed Mega Absol, and it usually grants a safe turn to Mega Evolve against faster threats. Play Rough is a great way to hit Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Salamence, Krookodile, and Chesnaught, super effectively, but Superpower can be used for greater power if the stat drops aren't troublesome. Superpower does not hit Fighting- and Dragon-types super effectively, however.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The 4 Special Defense EVs give common Download users an Attack boost instead of a Special Attack boost. 252 Attack EVs maximize Mega Absol's damage output, while maximum Speed is used to Speed tie with other base 115 Speed Pokemon. An Absolite is the only item you want to equip, as non-Mega Absol is unviable in UU. Justified can be used to let Absol switch into weak Dark-type moves before Mega Evolving to get a free Attack boost. An Adamant nature can be used for a slight power increase, but Jolly is the preferred nature to outspeed Pokemon such as Froslass and Infernape after Mega Evolving.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Do not be reckless switching Mega Absol into attacks. It is extremely frail and can't take many hits, sometimes even resisted ones, especially if there are entry hazards up. Mega Absol does, however, have plenty of free switch opportunities to defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, because most of them fear Knock Off and Magic Bounce, which gives Absol a free turn of setup. However, Mega Absol is best used for late-game cleaning, once its checks and counters have taken prior damage. Before Mega Evolving, Absol can switch into a predicted weak Dark-type attack, such as Knock Off, as the damage is reduced when the target is holding a Mega Stone, to get a free Attack boost due to Justified. Very few things are safe switch-ins to Mega Absol at +2 or even +1 thanks to its massive Attack stat, so finding opportunities to set up are a must.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Mega Absol appreciates the extra damage entry hazards give foes when it is attempting to sweep, so Pokemon such as Forretress, which also handles Florges, Aromatisse, and Mega Aggron, that can set up Stealth Rock are decent choices. Roserade is a good teammate that can handle Florges, one of Mega Absol's biggest checks, and can cripple other switch-ins with Sleep Powder. Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Rotom-H or Mienshao, can provide good opportunities for Mega Absol to get up a free Swords Dance.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Mega Absol works as a decent Pursuit trapper if the foe is afraid of taking a Knock Off. Iron Tail can be used to hit Pokemon such as Florges, although the 75% accuracy is a huge downfall. A combination of Swords Dance and Baton Pass can be used to pass boosts to teammates. Mixed Mega Absol with Fire Blast to hit Forretress or Ice Beam to hit Salamence is an option if the rest of your team has trouble with them. Will-O-Wisp is a nice lure that can burn common switch-ins such as Donphan and Salamence.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Mega Aggron</strong>: Mega Aggron can easily tank any move other than Fire Blast, which doesn't even do much, and has a large chance to OHKO back with Heavy Slam.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Dedicated physical walls such as Suicune, Rhyperior, Swampert, and Donphan can take hits relatively well. Suicune can fish for Scald burns, while Donphan OHKOes after a bit of prior damage.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats that have enough bulk to survive a Sucker Punch, such as Crobat and Choice Scarf Mienshao can take advantage of Mega Absol's mediocre bulk.</p>

<p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Florges resist Mega Absol's STAB moves and take little from any move outside of Iron Tail. Most have a good chance to OHKO with Moonblast.</p>

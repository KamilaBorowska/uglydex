<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Noivern has fantastic base 123 Speed and base 97 Special Attack that is perfect for moderate wallbreaking. Its good offensive typing allows Noivern to work well with synergistic offensive cores. It also resists the common Fire-, Water-, Grass-type cores that run amok in UnderUsed. Noivern has utility value in Taunt and Roost. Noivern might seem outclassed by other Dragon-type wallbreakers, but its Speed gives it the opportunity to run an effective Choice Specs set and destroy unprepared teams. Furthermore, because of its access to Taunt and Roost, Noivern has more surprise value than most other offensive Dragon-types in the tier.</p>

<h1>Choice Specs</h1>

<div class=set>
    Noivern @ Choice Specs<br>
    Ability: Infiltrator<br>
    EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Draco Meteor<br>- Hurricane<br>- Flamethrower / Air Slash<br>- Switcheroo / U-turn
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Draco Meteor is the classic go-to wallbreaking Dragon-type move once Fairy-type Pokemon such as Florges have been dealt with. Hurricane is another powerful STAB move, though it can miss. Flamethrower offers coverage on Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Jirachi, while Air Slash offers a reliable secondary STAB option with a 30% chance to flinch. Switcheroo lets Noivern cripple a check or counter that attempts to take a wallbreaking move, while U-turn gives Noivern the chance to further retain momentum if it finds the matchup to be poor.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>A spread of 252 SpA / 252 Spe gives Noivern the most out of this set, allowing it to his as hard and fast as possible. 4 SpD EVs prevent the rare Download Porygon-Z from setting up. Choice Specs allows Noivern to wallbreak almost all non-resisting Pokemon that do not have reliable recovery. Infiltrator completely voids the usefulness of the foe's Substitutes.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Noivern is best sent in on switches that help retain momentum. Choice Specs Noivern is not like Choice Specs Hydreigon in that it can simply spam Draco Meteor. Rather, Noivern shines with its wallbreaking abilities when it is used as a cleanup sweeper or opportunistic stallbreaker. Do not use this Noivern as a lead. Instead, use it opportunistically as a mid-game wallbreaker or end-game sweeper. This set also finds niche viability on rain teams, due to 100% accurate Hurricanes.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>This set pairs fantastically with Wish + Baton Pass Vaporeon, as well as bulky U-turn and Volt Switch users, as they create opporunities for Noivern to wallbreak. Jirachi also helps with the Fairy-types that plague Noivern's existence. Coincidentally, Florges and Whimsicott are good teammates that can prevent Choice Scarf Hydreigon from doing significant damage to your team. Chandelure can help as a spinblocker and provides an answer to Steel-types that Noivern generally struggles with. Additionally, Noivern appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog support. Noivern likes entry hazards on the opposing end of the field too, though, as Noivern forces a lot of switches.</p>

<h1>Taunt + Roost</h1>

<div class=set>
    Noivern @ Leftovers / Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Infiltrator<br>
    EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Draco Meteor<br>- Flamethrower / Air Slash<br>- Taunt<br>- Roost
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Draco Meteor takes care of all frail attackers while managing to snag some 2HKOs on Pokemon such as Donphan. Flamethrower is a good coverage move against many Steel-types, especially Forretress. Air Slash is a reliable STAB move with a 30% chance to flinch. Taunt prevents entry hazards from being set up on your side of the field. It also takes some pressure off prediction when dealing with setup sweepers such as Crocune. Roost is for added longevity.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EV spread provides offensive pressure against entry hazard stackers and status users. Leftovers provides passive recovery and is a good option alongside Roost. Life Orb is another option for harder-hitting STAB attacks, scoring some extra 2HKOs on Roserade and Shaymin, and scoring OHKOs on Pokemon such as Absol or Machamp. Infiltrator completely voids the usefulness of the opposing Pokemon's Substitute.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This set serves as a reasonable anti-lead, as it checks Azelf and other common leads. It is effective against Forretress, non-Choice Scarf Jirachi, and other entry hazard stackers. Noivern appreciates Pokemon that help retain momentum, giving it the opportunity to wallbreak. Despite its effective role as an anti-lead, it can be saved as a late-game sweeper.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Most of Noivern's problems come from its Flying / Dragon typing, therefore, Noivern enjoys support from Pokemon such as Wish + Baton Pass Vaporeon and bulky U-turn Jirachi, as they can relieve the need to predict. Further, Wish + Baton Pass + U-turn cores create opportunities to appropriately send out Noivern. Jirachi also helps with the Fairy-types that plague Noivern's existence. Chandelure can help as a spinblocker and provides an answer to the Steel-types that Noivern generally struggles with. Further, Noivern appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog support. Noivern apreciates entry hazards on the opposing end of the field too, though, as it forces a lot of switches, so Rapid Spin support is preferred.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>One can opt for a bulkier spread, focusing more on HP as opposed to Special Attack. In this instance, make sure Noivern is always left with an odd HP number (such as 351), in order to switch in on Stealth Rock as many times as possible. Focus Blast is an option against Steel-types, but is generally inferior to Flamethrower due to its unreliable accuracy. Boomburst is a reliable powerful non-STAB move for the Choice Specs set. Expert Belt offers a little bit more power against Steel-type switch-ins, and it also provides a Choice item bluff. Draco Plate is another option that is useful for bluffing a Choice item while hitting 20% harder off the bat. Super Fang is another option for the Taunt + Roost set, allowing Noivern to surprise common switch-ins such as Florges or Blissey.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Whimsicott and all Florges shut Noivern down bar Hurricane for the former.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types that have the possibility of carrying Ice Beam scare Noivern. Noivern specifically struggles against Empoleon.</p>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Noivern struggles against Mega Aggron and Jirachi once it locks itself into a move.</p>

<p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: After the initial Draco Meteor, your opponent may seize an opportunity to set up a sweeper, such as setting up Substitute + Calm Mind Raikou.</p>

<p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong> Noivern absolutely requires Rapid Spin or Defog support to survive, as Stealth Rock wears it down.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Due to Noivern's lackluster defenses, fast and powerful attackers such as Crobat, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Beedrill can take it out.</p>

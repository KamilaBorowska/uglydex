<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>In a tier where the main defensive typing is Water, Grass-type sweepers are highly sought after, as they are able to use Water-types as setup fodder. Virizion is one of the best of these, as it sports an excellent 108 base Speed as well as base 90 offenses. Virizion isn't frail either, as it sports a decent 91 / 72 / 129 bulk. Furthermore, Virizion has access to a plethora of support moves such as Light Screen and Taunt. Lastly, Virizion can complement its offenses with two great boosting moves in Swords Dance and Calm Mind.</p>

<h1>Swords Dance</h1>

<div class=set>
    Virizion @ Lum Berry<br>
    Ability: Justified<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Swords Dance<br>- Leaf Blade<br>- Close Combat<br>- Stone Edge / Zen Headbutt
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Virizion doesn't hit hard initially, making Swords Dance a good way to boost Virizion's Attack stat by two stages. Leaf Blade is a good STAB attack that also has a high critical hit ratio. Close Combat is another good STAB attack that has a high Base Power of 120, although it lowers Virizion's defenses, making Virizion more prone to being revenge killed. Stone Edge is a good coverage move that allows Virizion to hit Flying-types and Chandelure, which wall Virizion otherwise, for super effective damage. Zen Headbutt allows Virizion to hit Poison-types, which resist Virizion's STAB types, for super effective damage.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>A Lum Berry is chosen as Virizion's held item, as it allows Virizion to have a one-time immunity to status. A Life Orb can be used over this to give Virizion more immediate attacking power, but this makes it harder for Virizion to switch into bulky Water-types. 252 EVs are put into Attack and Speed to maximize Virizion's sweeping potential. A Jolly nature is used in order to Speed tie with other positive-natured base 108 Speed Pokemon, namely Cobalion and Infernape.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Virizion should be sent in mid- or late-game to have the easiest time sweeping. Virizion should also take advantage of its typing by using bulky Water-types as setup fodder. Flying-types tend to switch into Virizion, so attempt to take advantage of that by either switching to the appropriate Pokemon or using Stone Edge on a predicted switch.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Wallbreakers make for excellent partners, as they allow Virizion to sweep with ease, so consider using Choice Specs Hydreigon or Choice Band Heracross alongside it. Virizion appreciates entry hazard support, making entry hazard setters such as Forretress and Nidoqueen good teammates. Cleaners, such as Speed Boost Yanmega and Mega Sharpedo, make for good teammates as well, as they can capitalize on Virizion's ability to weaken a team during a sweep. Lastly, Rock-types, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum, make for good teammates, as they take care of Ice-, Flying-, and Fire-types that stop Virizion from sweeping.</p>

<h1>Calm Mind</h1>

<div class=set>
    Virizion @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Justified<br>
    EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Calm Mind<br>- Giga Drain<br>- Focus Blast<br>- Hidden Power Rock / Synthesis / Substitute
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Calm Mind boosts Virizion's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage, making Virizion a good special sweeper. Giga Drain allows Virizion to regain health while attempting a sweep. Focus Blast is a secondary STAB attack that hits hard. Hidden Power Rock gives Virizion super effective coverage against Flying-types and Chandelure, which wall this set otherwise. Synthesis gives Virizion reliable recovery, which can be crucial when attempting to sweep. Substitute on the other hand allows Virizion to set up more easily against bulky Water-types that don't have Ice Beam.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Max Speed and Special Attack EVs are used to augment Virizion's sweeping potential. Leftovers is the chosen item, as it gives Virizion a form of passive recovery. A Timid nature is chosen in order to make full use of Virizion's good Speed tier.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Virizion should always attempt to use bulky Water-types as setup fodder. Virizion can also set up against Choice-locked special attackers that cannot KO it, such as Choice Scarf Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. A sweep should only be attempted during mid- or late-game, as Virizion's checks and counters would still be healthy beforehand.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Clerics, such as Blissey and Florges, make for good teammates to Virizion, as they can remove any status inflicted upon Virizion. Wallbreakers, such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Choice Band Entei, make for good partners, as they remove or weaken walls that threaten to stop Virizion from sweeping. Rock-types, such as Rhyperior and Mega Aerodactyl, also make for good Virizion teammates, as they can deal with Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-types that threaten Virizion.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Virizion gets access to Light Screen and Reflect, making a support set with both of those along with Taunt a possibility; however, such a set is outclassed by Espeon and Azelf. Sacred Sword could be used over Close Combat on the Swords Dance set should the Defense and Special Defense drops seem detrimental, but it is generally not worth it. A Life Orb can also be utilized by Virizion to give it more immediate power before setting up.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types, such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, easily take Virizion's STAB attacks and can OHKO with their STAB attacks, although they have to be wary of Stone Edge.</p>

<p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types resist both of Virizion's STAB attacks and can retaliate with their own super effective STAB attacks; Mega Beedrill and Toxicroak are examples of this.</p>

<p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types, such as Reuniclus and Cresselia, can take any boosted hit by Virizion and proceed to KO Virizion with a STAB attack.</p>

<p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users and naturally faster Pokemon, such as Mienshao and Alakazam respectively, can easily revenge kill Virizion after getting a free switch into it. Whimsicott gets a special mention for being able to resist both of Virizion's STAB attacks and either lock it into a support move with Encore or KO it with a STAB Moonblast.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types, such as Entei, defensive Arcanine, and Chandelure, can easily take an unboosted STAB attack from Virizion and OHKO in return, although they have to be wary of Stone Edge.</p>

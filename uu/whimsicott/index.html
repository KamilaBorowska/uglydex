<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Whimsicott is a great Pokemon thanks to Prankster, as well as its brilliant support movepool that includes Encore, Taunt, and Memento, as well as Prankster. It also has a high Speed stat, which lets it scout easily with U-turn and outspeed all other Prankster users but Tornadus. Whimsicott gained a new Fairy-typing in XY, and now resists Dark- and Fighting-type moves, has immunity to Dragon-type moves, which makes it as good as ever at forcing switches. However, its new typing brings new weaknesses. Whimsicott is now 4x weak to Poison, and has a new weakness to Steel-type moves. It is also walled by Grass-types such as Celebi and Roserade and has little offensive presence. It also has lackluster bulk for a supportive Pokemon, but Whimsicott still has all it needs to be a great team supporter.</p>

</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Encore cripples many Pokemon that try to setup, and this can force multiple switches. Stun Spore allows Whimsicott to support its teammates by paralyzing problematic sweepers, and it has +1 priority thanks to Prankster. The third move is a toss up and depends on what your team needs, as all of these moves are great. U-turn provides great momentum for the team, and it is very useful in conjunction with Encore as well as for scouting out moves. However, Memento lets Whimsicott sacrifice itself to lower its opponent's offensive stats harshly, and is great on offensive teams. Pokemon which appreciate this kind of support include Swords Dance Lucario, Nasty Plot Azelf, and Infernape. Substitute can also be used to block status and ease prediction. The last move is also a toss up. Taunt provides great utility and shuts down most defensive Pokemon and prevents Whimsicott from being Taunted itself. It also prevents sweepers from setting up. Moonblast can be used too and is a decent STAB attack which hits many Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Leech Seed is great at forcing switches and keeps Whimsicott and its teammates healthy.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Leftovers allows for consistent recovery as Whimsicott often comes in multiple times and gives it quite a bit of staying power when combined with Leech Seed. The given EV spread maximizes Whimsicott's ability to take physical hits and minimizes Stealth Rock damage as Whimsicott will be switching often. An Impish nature should be used if Whimsicott is not running Moonblast. However, a Bold nature should be used instead if Whimsicott is running Moonblast.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Use Stun Spore and Encore often to support your team and cripple Pokemon, and set up on defensive Pokemon such as Forretress. Use U-turn often as well to scout out moves and, due to the amount of switches Whimsicott can cause, gain valuable momentum. Do not stay in on powerful super effective attacks, as Whimsicott's bulk is subpar and it will most likely be felled by them.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Steel-types such as Empoleon and Jirachi make excellent partners because they have excellent type synergy with Whimsicott, as they can take the incoming Poison-, Ice-, and Steel-type moves for it. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress is recommended as Whimsicott often forces switches, and residual damage can stack up quickly for the opponent. Cleric support from Florges or Umbreon is really appreciated as Whimsicott will be worn down fast and has no way to cure status it may have been inflicted with. Fire-types such as Darmanitan and Chandelure make good partners because they can take care of the Fire- and Grass-type Pokemon that like to switch into Whimsicott. In addition, Ground-types such as Dugtrio also make good partners because they can eliminate the Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-types for Whimsicott.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Whimsicott has a lot of other interesting options. Tailwind can be used to provide support for its team, making normally slow Pokemon faster. Sunny Day with Heat Rock and Prankster can help sun teams. Cotton Guard can make Whimsicott bulky, but due to the lack of reliable recovery and the amount of weaknesses it has, it won't do a very good job. Tickle can be used and is a good option that allows a teammate to get in with more ease. Cotton Spore can be used but is generally inferior to Stun Spore. Grass Whistle is far too inaccurate to work most of the time. Lastly, Infiltrator and Switcheroo can also work, but is not useful in general.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Nidoking and Roserade resist both of Whimsicott's moves and can KO with their respective STAB moves.</p>

<p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Magic Bounce users such as Xatu and Mega Absol can deflect the non-damaging moves Whimsicott carries.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Chandelure, Darmanitan, and Entei force Whimsicott out with their powerful STAB moves.</p>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade can switch into Leech Seed and U-turn doesn't do much to them because of Whimsicott's only average Attack stat.</p>

<p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute blocks Leech Seed and Stun Spore, and Whimsicott will most likely fail to break them.</p>

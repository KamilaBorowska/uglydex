<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>One would think a Pokemon with monstrous defensive stats and horrible attacking stats would never find a place on hyper offense, but Shuckle makes for an excellent lead thanks to its access to Stealth Rock and Sticky Web. Also, because of Shuckle's access to Sturdy, it can run a Mental Herb to negate Taunt once, guaranteeing that it can set up at least one entry hazard. Because of its high defensive stats, it has the bulk to often set both entry hazards. Shuckle also has a great support movepool including access to Encore, Infestation, and Knock Off. Sadly, Shuckle is held back by its extremely low Speed and lack of offensive presence.</p>

<h1>Holy Shuck!</h1>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Sticky Web lowers the Speed of a foe switching in by one stage, allowing a slow, strong wallbreaker to become a threatening sweeper. Stealth Rock wears down foes, allowing your Pokemon to score OHKOs and 2HKOs they wouldn't otherwise. Encore locks the foe into the move that they last used, allowing you to easily switch in a Pokemon of your choice, as the foe is either forced to switch out or hit your Pokemon with a weak attack. Toxic is Shuckle's best way of dealing damage and can be used to wear down spinners and Defoggers with the exception of Forretress, Crobat, and Empoleon by spamming Stealth Rock and Sticky Web until Toxic KOes them. Knock Off can be used to remove the foe's item, but it deals very little damage. Finally, Infestation can be used to trap foes and has good synergy with Encore.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EVs don't really do much for Shuckle, but extra Defense allows Shuckle to take multi-hit moves better, as they are all physical, and allows Shuckle to set up entry hazards against more threats. The combination of Sturdy and a Mental Herb guarantees that Shuckle is able to set up at least one layer of entry hazards, as Sturdy guarantees Shuckle survives one attack and Mental Herb grants a one-time immunity to Taunt or Encore.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Shuckle is best used as a suicide lead for offensive teams that can take advantage of the lowered Speed of the foes. However, if you can keep Shuckle around for later in the game to switch in and set up switching opportunities using Encore, then that is a good course of action.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Strong wallbreakers such as Krookidile, Chandelure, Exploud, Lucario, Darmanitan, Machamp, and Heracross make for good partners for their ability to take advantage of Sticky Web and smash holes in the opponent's team. Chandelure gets a special mention for being able to spinblock thanks to its Ghost typing. Also, fast Taunt users such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl make for good partners for their ability to prevent the opponent from Defogging.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Though Shuckle should only be seriously used to set up Stealth Rock and Sticky Web, it does have a few other options. It can use Accupressure to set up and potentially sweep the opponent's team, but it is incredibly luck-reliant. Also, Power Split can be used to cripple incoming foes by cutting their attacking stats.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Espeon, Mega Absol, and Xatu bounce back all of Shuckle's supporting moves and Shuckle can't do much at all to them.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Users of Rapid Spin and Defog such as Blastoise, Tentacruel, Aerodactyl, Crobat, Empoleon, and the occasional Flygon can clear away Shuckle's entry hazards with ease.</p>

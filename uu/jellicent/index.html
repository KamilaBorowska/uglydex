<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Jellicent has an excellent Water / Ghost typing and decent defensive stats to go along with it. It also has access to Will-O-Wisp and Recover, allowing it to stall out the majority of the metagame. Furthermore, it has a Water immunity, thanks to Water Absorb, and it can spinblock because of its Ghost typing. This gives Jellicent the capability to counter Calm Mind Suicune; this is one of its main niches. However, Jellicent is somewhat slow and only has an average offensive presence. It is also very susceptible to status as Jellicent has no way of curing it.</p>

<h1>Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Jellicent @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Water Absorb<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 200 Def / 12 SpD / 44 Spe<br>
    Bold Nature<br>
    - Scald<br>- Recover<br>- Will-O-Wisp / Toxic<br>- Taunt / Ice Beam / Shadow Ball
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Scald is a great STAB move and has a high 30% chance to burn. Recover keeps Jellicent healthy throughout the match. The third move is a toss-up. Will-O-Wisp is the preferred move, as it is more reliable for burning the opponent than Scald. However, Toxic can be used to put a timer on deadly walls, though it can clash with Scald's chance to burn. The last move is also a matter of preference. Taunt is the preferred move, as it allows Jellicent to beat Pokemon such as Blissey one-on-one and avoid being Toxic + Soft-Boiled stalled. Taunt also prevents Pokemon such as Forretress and Donphan from setting up entry hazards and lets Jellicent counter Calm Mind Suicune. However, Ice Beam can be used to hit Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade harder. Shadow Ball can also be used, serving as a secondary STAB move.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EV spread maximizes Jellicent's physical bulk and allows it to outspeed Pokemon with base 65 Speed such as Umbreon and Chesnaught, while the Special Defense EVs give Download users such as Porygon2 and Porygon-Z an Attack boost when they switch in. Leftovers provides Jellicent with passive recovery and makes it harder to take out when combined with Recover. A Bold nature is used to further increase Jellicent's physical bulk. Water Absorb is the ability of choice, as Cursed Body and Damp aren't that useful, and it gives Jellicent an useful Water immunity.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Try not to get Jellicent inflicted with status, as it will get worn down really easily. Use Will-O-Wisp or Toxic frequently to support teammates. In addition, use Recover sparingly, as it will be very important against defensive teams. Switch into Water-type attacks so Jellicent can recover a bit of its HP. You can also switch Jellicent into Rapid Spin users such as Forretress and Donphan and status or attack them. Use Taunt to shut down walls.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin or Defog users such as Forretress and Flygon make good partners because Jellicent is susceptible to all entry hazards and is worn down quickly. In addition, cleric support from Blissey, Florges, and Umbreon is greatly appreciated because Jellicent has no other way of curing status. Entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Forretress make for excellent partners because they appreciate Jellicent's ability to spinblock. Lastly, Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Hippowdon can switch into Electric-type moves aimed at it, as well as set up Stealth Rock which Jellicent can keep on the field, although they share a Grass-type weakness.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>A specially defensive EV spread can be used to allow Jellicent to check many special attackers such as Nidoking. Pain Split can be used, but Recover is a more reliable method of recovery. Hydro Pump and Water Spout are stronger STAB moves than Scald, but Jellicent is outclassed in offensive roles, and Scald is a must on bulky Water-types. It can run an offensive set or a Choice Specs set, but as stated previously, it is outclassed by Pokemon such as Starmie and Mega Blastoise. Trick Room can be used to reverse the turn order, but Pokemon such as Cofagrigus do it better. Cursed Body is an option, but Water Absorb is a much better ability as it gives Jellicent an immunity.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Grass-types with Natural Cure</strong>: Grass-types with Natural Cure such as Celebi, Shaymin, and Roserade are unaffected by Will-O-Wisp and can force Jellicent out with their strong STAB attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Honchkrow and Krookodile hate being burned by Scald and Will-O-Wisp, but they can force Jellicent out with their STAB moves.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt shuts down Jellicent and renders it useless.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Status effects such as burn and poison will wear down Jellicent quickly.</p>

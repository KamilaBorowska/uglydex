<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>After spending nearly an entire generation in OU thanks to being one of the best answers to the prominent Drizzle playstyle, Gastrodon has lost quite a bit of viability due to the weather nerf. It still has a marginal niche in the UU metagame, however, as it is one of the metagame's best answers to common Water-types, such as Suicune and Swampert. This niche is due to Gastrodon's ability, Storm Drain, which not only lets it switch in on most Water-types, but also gives it a Special Attack boost, which can make it much more annoying to face. It also has a large number of resistances in addition to an immunity to Electric-type attacks. It even has reliable recovery to prevent it from being worn down quickly, a problem some walls have in UU.</p>

<p>However, Gastrodon is not without its flaws. Grass-types such as Shaymin and Celebi can all switch into Gastrodon with little cost and can easily KO it with their STAB Grass-type moves. Gastrodon also has pitiful Speed, making it rely on its bulk more than it would like to if it wants to stay alive. All in all, however, Gastrodon is a great fit for many bulky teams and should not be overlooked.</p>

<h1>Physically Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Gastrodon @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Storm Drain<br>
    EVs: 216 HP / 252 Def / 40 SpD<br>
    Relaxed / Bold Nature<br>
    - Scald<br>- Earthquake / Earth Power<br>- Toxic / Ice Beam<br>- Recover
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Earth Power is Gastrodon's most reliable STAB move, as it can be taken advantage of with the Storm Drain boost and can hit quite hard at +1, even without investment. However, Earthquake can be used instead to hit Pokemon like Raikou, Tentacruel, and Specially Defensive or CM variants of Jirachi for more damage. Scald is Gastrodon's other reliable STAB move, as it can cripple a lot of physical attackers, patching up Gastrodon's lackluster physical defense to make it more difficult to KO as an overall mixed wall. Toxic is a great utility move, as it can cripple common switch-ins, such as Jellicent and Swampert, that don't really care about Gastrodon's other moves. Ice Beam hits Dragon-types that it can switch in on with relative ease, such as Flygon, as well as Grass-types like Chesnaught. Recover is necessary, as without it, Gastrodon will not last as long.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EVs, along with a Bold or Relaxed nature, are to maximize Gastrodon's physical bulk, which is quite medicore when uninvested, and makes Gastrodon a great mixed wall thanks to its high HP stat and good Special Defense stat. A Relaxed nature should be used if running Earthquake, as Gastrodon can afford to run both physical and special attacks due to its horrific Speed. The HP EVs are to maximize Gastrodon's Leftovers recovery. Leftovers gives Gastrodon residual recovery each turn and can make it a pain to deal with, especially when coupled with Recover.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This set takes advantage of Gastrodon's great mixed bulk, as even with base 68 Defense, it can still be very annoying for a good portion of physical attackers due to its access to Scald and its massive HP stat. Gastrodon also has the advantage of being able to switch into a very large portion of the Water-types in the tier, and can force some of them out with Scald and/or Toxic.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Fire-types, such as Victini, Darmanitan, and Mega Houndoom, who can force out a large portion of Grass-types are good partners for Gastrodon, and they can also bait Water-type attacks for Gastrodon to receive a Storm Drain boost. As Gastrodon is very susceptible to Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, a cleric can be used to increase its walling capabilities. Pokemon that have good defensive synergy with Gastrodon, such as Crobat, pair well with it. Crobat works especially well because it resists Grass-types, can break through Fighting-types such Scrafty and Mienshao, and can clear entry hazards that Gastrodon hates, mainly Toxic Spikes. Pokemon that can set up on Blissey and Florges, such as Toxicroak and Jirachi, are also great partners for Gastrodon.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>An offensive set with Mystic Water or Life Orb can be used, as Gastrodon makes for a very potent tank when coupled with a Storm Drain boost. However, Gastrodon is somewhat outclassed at this role, even at +1, by attackers like Mega Blastoise. A specially defensive set can be used, though you're better off investing in Gastrodon's rather low physical defense, as it already has high natural Special Defense. Curse can be used, as it increases Gastrodon's bulk and power while decreasing its already terrible speed; however, you don't get to take advantage of the Storm Drain boost. Counter and Mirror Coat can be used, because they can net surprise kills on a lot of Pokemon, but as Gastrodon doesn't get OHKOed very often, it's very situational. Sticky Hold can be used to make Gastrodon a decent Knock Off absorber; however, this is usually obscenely inferior to Storm Drain.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Celebi and Shaymin don't care about Scald burns and can easily threaten Gastrodon out with their STAB moves or set up on it, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Toxic users</strong>: Pokemon that carry Toxic, such as Blissey, can easily wear down Gastrodon while Gastrodon can do nothing back, as Blissey tanks all of Gastrodon's moves with ease.</p>

<p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Strong attackers like Porygon-Z, Hydreigon, and Kyurem are good answers to Gastrodon as they can take its hits with ease and can hit it for a large amount of damage, sometimes even OHKOing it.</p>

<p><strong>Lures</strong>: A lot of Pokemon that Gastrodon usually switches into, like Jirachi, Starmie, and Chandelure, can run Energy Ball or Grass Knot as a lure, making it much harder for Gastrodon to switch in.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Arcanine has solid stats across the board, with nothing being completely unusable. Arcanine has two fantastic abilities, Flash Fire and Intimidate, and both of them are extremely useful in many situations. Arcanine stands out as an offensive Fire-type with great coverage moves such as Crunch, Close Combat, Extreme Speed, and Wild Charge, allowing it to clean up solidly late-game. However, Arcanine also has a niche as a defensive Fire-type, as its Defense skyrockets after an Intimidate, making it a great switch-in to physical attacks. Having decent recovery in Morning Sun also helps its cause; however, Arcanine has a huge weakness to Stealth Rock, making it hard to switch in multiple times if entry hazards are set up.</p>

<h1>Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Arcanine @ Leftovers / Rocky Helmet<br>
    Ability: Intimidate<br>
    EVs: 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Def<br>
    Impish Nature<br>
    - Morning Sun<br>- Will-O-Wisp / Toxic<br>- Flare Blitz<br>- Extreme Speed / Roar
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Morning Sun gives Arcanine a solid way to recover HP; however, be aware of the changes that take place under weather. Will-O-Wisp burns the foe for residual damage and lowers the foe's Attack stat. Toxic can be used for physical walls such as Swampert, which does not take much damage from Arcanine's Flare Blitz, and gives more residual damage than Will-O-Wisp. Flare Blitz is a powerful STAB move that hits hard, even without investment, and it prevents Arcanine from being too passive, although the recoil can slowly wear down Arcanine after enough use. Extreme Speed can be used to pick off weakened or faster foes if needed. Roar can be used to force out foes that attempt to set up if Arcanine is not in a position to recover damage from Flare Blitz recoil.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EVs maximize Arcanine's physical bulk while allowing it to take less damage from Stealth Rock upon switching in and giving Arcanine a Leftovers number. An Impish nature raises Arcanine's solid physical bulk. Leftovers maximizes Arcanine's time on the field while slightly reducing the damage taken from possible recoil moves and entry hazards. Rocky Helmet is another option to punish common U-turn users such as Mienshao and Crobat. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 196 Def / 64 Spe can be used to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and attempt to KO it with Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Arcanine does not appreciate the extra damage taken from Stealth Rock, as upon switching in, losing 25% of its total HP is extremely detrimental and will reduce Arcanine's time on the field tremendously. Arcanine, after an Intimidate, is a fantastic pivot into physical attackers such as Entei, Mienshao, and Heracross. Arcanine appreciates having bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel KOed or at least substantially weakened, as these Pokemon are generally a free switch-in to all of Arcanine's attacks and can force it out. Morning Sun only has 8 PP, so knowing when to recover, usually on an opponent's predicted switch, is vital.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Arcanine appreciates a Defogger or a Rapid Spin user as a partner so it does not have to waste a turn using Morning Sun to recover the damage taken from entry hazards. Mega Blastoise works as a fantastic teammate that can not only clear away entry hazards, but scare away the Rock-type Pokemon that can threaten Arcanine. Grass-type Pokemon such as Shaymin and Whimiscott can switch in comfortably on most Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Arcanine. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Florges can switch in on special attacks that were meant for Arcanine.</p>

<h1>Offensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Arcanine @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Flash Fire / Intimidate<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly / Adamant Nature<br>
    - Flare Blitz<br>- Extreme Speed<br>- Wild Charge<br>- Close Combat / Crunch
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Flare Blitz is Arcanine's most powerful attack, and it is backed by high Base Power and STAB. Extreme Speed can hit faster foes such as Mega Beedrill or Mienshao after they have been weakened. Wild Charge does a hefty chunk to bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune, Alomomola, Empoleon, and Tentacruel. Close Combat hits Dark-type Pokemon such as Hydregion and Umbreon and Rock-type Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Tyrantrum super effectively. Crunch hits Chandelure, which takes minimal damage from any of Arcanine's attacks and can get a Flash Fire boost from being hit by Flare Blitz, for super effective damage. Morning Sun is an option to heal off the massive damage that Arcanine receives from its recoil moves.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Attack EVs allow Arcanine to hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed allows Arcanine to outspeed Jolly Heracross, Entei and non-Choice Scarf Krookodile. An Adamant nature allows Arcanine to hit harder with its attacks and 2HKO Suicune with Wild Charge after Stealth Rock damage and a small amount of chip damage. Flash Fire allows Arcanine to freely switch into a predicted Fire move, such as Will-O-Wisp, and it boosts Flare Blitz's power to insane levels. Intimidate is an option to give Arcanine fantastic physical bulk even without investment. Life Orb boosts Arcanine's Attack power and gives it the freedom of switching moves; however, it gets worn down extremely fast with the combination of Life Orb and Flare Blitz recoil.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Heavy prediction is needed when using Arcanine, as incoming Flash Fire users may get a boost from its Flare Blitz and bulky Water-type Pokemon might get a free switch in. Keep in mind the massive recoil Arcanine receives from the combination of Life Orb and Flare Blitz or Wild Charge, especially if there are entry hazards on the field. Do not switch Arcanine in multiple times when there are entry hazards on your side of the field, as taking 25% upon entry limits Arcanine's time even more.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Considering Arcanine has an awful weakness to Stealth Rock, a Defogger or Rapid Spin user is nearly mandatory as a partner. Empoleon and Mega Blastoise can not only clear hazards, but they can threaten out Rock-type Pokemon with their STAB attacks. Grass- or Water-type Pokemon such as Chesnaught and Suicune can switch into predicted Ground and Water-type attacks aimed at Arcanine. When using Intimidate, special walls such as Florges and Blissey can freely switch into special attacks that Arcanine might have trouble taking.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Overheat can hit physical walls that try to switch into Arcanine hard, and Arcanine will not receive the nasty recoil associated with Flare Blitz. A Choice Band can be used over Life Orb to hit with more firepower and avoid the recoil taken from Life Orb; however, Arcanine usually appreciates the ability to switch between its coverage moves.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Flash Fire users</strong>: Flash Fire users, especially Chandelure and defensive Arcanine itself, can freely switch into Arcanine's Flare Blitz and get a boost to their own Fire-type moves. Chandelure fears switching into a Toxic or Crunch, however.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entry hazards severely limit Arcanine's time on the field, as Arcanine is immune to none of them and is weak to Stealth Rock.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Even with Wild Charge, most bulky Water-types, such as Alomomola and Suicune, can stall out Arcanine and make it take recoil damage.</p>

<p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Bulky Rock-types such as Rhyperior can wall Arcanine unless it has Close Combat, which still fails to 2HKO Rhyperior, although it must remain wary of Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, which even resists Extreme Speed, can revenge kill or threaten Arcanine out.</p>

<p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Krookodile, Donphan, and Hippodon can take on both Arcanine sets without much fear and can force Arcanine out with their respective STAB attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Hydreigon and Nidoqueen can hit Arcanine on its uninvested Special Defense. </p>

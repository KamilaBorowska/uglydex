<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Feraligatr possesses a decent base 105 Attack stat as well as two amazing stat boosting moves in Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, making it a very underrated setup sweeper. It also has a solid defensive typing that leaves it weak to only Grass- and Electric-type attacks. Combine this with satisfactory 85 / 100 / 83 bulk, and Feraligatr can easily take a hit and set up a boost. It also has very good coverage moves, such as Ice Punch and Crunch, meaning it can be hard to wall once it has set up. However, Feraligatr does have some notable flaws. Firstly, it has a base 78 Speed, meaning it fails to outspeed Pokemon such as Roserade before a Dragon Dance. Another glaring flaw for Feraligatr is the fact that his hidden ability, Sheer Force, is unreleased, forcing him to use Torrent. Feraligatr also faces competition as a set-up sweeper from Toxicroak, who is faster and has a better ability, as well as a wider movepool. Nonetheless, even with some flaws, Feraligatr can certainly be a huge threat if it sets up.</p>

<h1>Swords Dance</h1>

<div class=set>
    Feraligatr @ Life Orb / Mystic Water<br>
    Ability: Torrent<br>
    EVs: 56 HP / 252 Atk / 200 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Swords Dance<br>- Waterfall<br>- Aqua Jet<br>- Crunch / Return / Ice Punch
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Swords Dance boosts Feraligatr's Attack by two stages, allowing it to do massive damage to the opponent. Waterfall is Feraligatr's main STAB attack that does a ton of damage after a boost from Swords Dance. Aqua Jet is a great priority move that is boosted by STAB, and it allows Feraligatr to KO faster Pokemon. The last slot can be customized depending on what your team needs dealt with. Crunch allows Feraligatr to break through Psychic-types,  and gets good overall coverage. Return, in combination with Waterfall and Aqua Jet, provides perfect neutral coverage throughout the tier. Ice Punch hits Honchkrow and Hydreigon for super effective damage, making it a good coverage option as well. However, Earthquake can also be used to hit Raikou and other Electric-types, while Low Kick can be used to hit Hydreigon, but more importantly, Registeel.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature maximizes Feraligatr's Attack, letting it hit very hard after a Swords Dance boost. 200 Speed EVs allow Feraligatr to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and out-prioritize it with Aqua Jet. The remaining 56 HP EVs add to Feraligatr's overall bulk, helping it set up. Life Orb lets Feraligatr hit harder at the cost of some health. However, Mystic Water can also be used, to power up Waterfall and Aqua Jet and to keep Feraligatr healthy. This set is not as susceptible to priority due to the HP investment, which is a good thing going for it.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Once all of Feraligatr's counters have been removed or severely weakened, Swords Dance is safe to use. After Swords Dance is used once, Feraligatr turns into a powerful attacker, being able to hit extremely hard. Note that when Honchkrow switches in, Aqua Jet goes before Honchkrow's Sucker Punch and negates it. Lastly, this set is to be used as a late game sweeper more than anything else.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>To make setting up Swords Dance much easier, Feraligatr can benefit from Dual Screens support, making Cresselia and Uxie good teammates. Rotom-H is a good partner, as Trick cripples walls such as Suicune and Vaporeon, and it can also absorb Will-O-Wisp for Feraligatr. Spike setters are also very helpful as they weaken Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienshao to the point where Feraligatr to finish them off with a boosted Aqua Jet. This makes Pokemon such as Froslass and Roserade good partners, as they can set up Spikes with relative ease. Lastly, Sticky Web support is very helpful, as it allows Feraligatr to outspeed threats such as Toxicroak and Shaymin  which are heavily damaged by a boosted Return or Ice Punch.</p>

<h1>Dragon Dance</h1>

<div class=set>
    Feraligatr @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Torrent<br>
    EVs: 28 HP / 252 Atk / 228 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Dragon Dance<br>- Waterfall<br>- Ice Punch<br>- Earthquake
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Dragon Dance allows Feraligatr to boost its Attack and Speed by one stage, allowing it to sweep. Waterfall is Feraligatr's strongest STAB move, and is very threatening to Pokemon which don't resist it, especially after a boost from Dragon Dance. Ice Punch is a good coverage move that OHKOes both Honchkrow and Hydreigon after a Dragon Dance boost. Earthquake is a very powerful move that can KO threatening Electric-types such as Raikou, and can also take out Jirachi. Lastly, Aerial Ace has a relevant niche, as it 2HKOes Chesnaught and has a good chance to OHKO Toxicroak after a Dragon Dance.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>252 Attack EVs max out Feraligatr's Attack stat, allowing it to hit as hard as possible. 228 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Feraligatr to outspeed neutral nature base 120s after a Dragon Dance. 28 HP EVs are put into Feraligatr's HP to give it a little bit of extra bulk. Life Orb gives a significant boost to Feraligatr's damage output, making it the preferred item for this set. Feraligatr can also run a bulky variation of this set with an EV spread of 224 HP / 252 Atk / 34 Spe and a Jolly nature, allowing it to outspeed base 100s after a Dragon Dance while also improving its overall bulk.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Setting up Dragon Dance safely isn't very difficult for Feraligatr, though it is much more prone to being revenge killed or statused, as it can not outspeed threats who can revenge kill easily as well as status setters. Feraligatr needs threats such as Will-O-Wisp Sableye and Roserade weakened to the point where it can KO them, which is why setting up is not advised until these Pokemon have been removed. However, once all its counters have been removed, Feraligatr only needs to worry about attacking.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Feraligatr can make good use of Dual Screen support from the likes of Cresselia or Uxie, as it allows Feraligatr  to set up much easier. Feraligatr is very threatened by Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Suicune, making Chesnaught and Tangrowth very helpful partners to deal with them. Lastly, since Feraligatr is threatened by Will-O-Wisp, Rotom-H is a good partner to absorb Will-O-Wisp and neuter Pokemon such as Suicune with Trick.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Feraligatr can run a RestTalk set due to its decent bulk, but it is outclassed by other bulky Water-types such as Suicune in this role. Feraligatr also can use Superpower, but it lowers Feraligatr's Attack and Defense, and isn't worth using over Earthquake to hit Steel-types. Lastly, Feraligatr has a good special movepool, containing moves such as Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Focus Blast. However, its poor Special Attack stat prevents it from making good use of it.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Feraligatr is threatened by revenge killers such as Mienshao, Hydreigon, and Raikou, which outspeed and severely damage Feraligatr, even at +1. Pokemon that naturally outspeed Feraligatr such as Choice Specs Noivern can hit Feraligatr hard as well.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Feraligatr is threatened by burn and paralysis, as they both stop Feraligatr from sweeping effectively. Sableye is a good example of this.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Chesnaught, Tangrowth, and Vaporeon can switch in and tank a hit with relative ease. Vaporeon can burn Feraligatr with Scald while Tangrowth can Power Whip or status Feraligatr.</p>

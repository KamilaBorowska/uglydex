<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Tentacruel is blessed with a great typing, having many resistances in addition to great Special Defense and Speed. It also has access to great support moves, such as Rapid Spin and Toxic Spikes. However, Tentacruel is not without its faults; it faces stiff competition from other bulky Water-type Pokemon with Rapid Spin such as Blastoise. It has a subpar Defense, little to no offensive presence, and no reliable recovery options. It also has common weaknesses to Psychic-, Ground-, and Electric-type moves. Nonetheless, Tentacruel can be a great Pokemon to use in a team.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Scald's burn chance can help patch up Tentacruel's poor Defense while also providing it with a reliable STAB attack. Toxic Spikes is useful for the passive damage it inflicts on grounded Pokemon. It's also the main reason why you would use Tentacruel over other Rapid Spin users. Toxic is a nice alternative, as it can inflict poison on Flying-type or Pokemon with Levitate, which are not affected by Toxic Spikes. Knock Off removes items from opposing Pokemon, which helps greatly when facing stall-based teams. Rapid Spin is obviously the most important move, and allows Tentacruel to support its team by removing entry hazards.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EV spread aims to patch up Tentacruel's lackluster Defense and increase its overall bulk, allowing it to check the majority of physical attackers in the tier such as Mienshao and Infernape. A Bold nature further increases Tentacruel's Defense and allows Tentacruel to survive many physical hits. The Speed EVs allow Tentacruel to outspeed Pokemon such as Honchkrow and attempt to burn them with Scald. Black Sludge gives Tentacruel a way to recover lost HP from switching into entry hazards or from burn damage. Liquid Ooze lets Tentacruel fare better against Leech Seed users or other Pokemon that carry draining moves because they will lose HP instead.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Tentacruel has trouble switching into many physical moves, so be wary when switching into most physical attackers. Try not to get Tentacruel burned because it has no way of curing it without cleric support. As Tentacruel forces quite a bit of switches, using the time to set up Toxic Spikes is a good idea. If you're not running Toxic Spikes, using Scald to attempt to burn the next switch-in is a smart move, because it might cripple the Pokemon. In addition, use Rapid Spin to support your team when needed.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Celebi makes an excellent partner. It has great type synergy with Tentacruel as well as access to Heal Bell to cure status that would otherwise trouble Tentacruel. Many Fire-type Pokemon appreciate Tentacruel's Rapid Spin support such as Darmanitan, Chandelure, and Entei. However, they share a Ground-type weakness with Tentacruel. Tentacruel fits well on stall-based or balanced teams because it can absorb Toxic Spikes as well as set up its own. It also provides valuable Rapid Spin support. Although Tentacruel is a great team supporter, it appreciates support as well. Due to the fact that it has no reliable recovery or any way to remove status, Florges and Umbreon make excellent partners, as they have access to Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, respectively. Jirachi also makes a good teammate because it can set up Stealth Rock as well as pass Wishes, although it shares a Ground-type weakness with Tentacruel.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>The ability Rain Dish can be used on Rain Dance teams, but because the weather only lasts five to eight turns, it's not really good. Acid Spray and Sludge Bomb can be used to provide Poison-type STAB, though they have little use outside of that. An offensive Rapid Spin set can be used, though Starmie and Blastoise outclass Tentacruel in that regard. Mirror Coat is an interesting option that can be run to surprise many special attackers. An Assault Vest set with the EV spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 120 SpD / 16 Spe can be used to further increase Tentacruel's bulk and maximize it's Special Attack, however it loses useful support moves such as Toxic and Toxic Spikes, while also lacking the passive recovery from Black Sludge. A specially defensive EV spread can also be used to allow Tentacruel to better check special attackers such as Roserade and Houndoom. Protect can be used to allow Tentacruel Toxic stall a variety of Pokemon as well as allowing it to heal itself with Black Sludge, but it's hard to find a moveslot for it. A Choice Scarf or Choice Specs set can also be used, however as stated previously, Tentacruel loses its passive recovery from Black Sludge and its ability to utilize its great support options.</p>

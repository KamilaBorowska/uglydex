<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Zebstrika is the second fastest relevant Pokemon in the metagame, and with its good coverage, it makes for a great revenge killer and is also good at cleaning up late-game. Zebstrika's main niche over other Electric-types are its superior Speed, ability Sap Sipper, and access to Overheat, which give it a unique niche over Raichu and Rotom-F. It also has access to Volt Switch, a useful move that allows it to switch out of its checks and counters and gain momentum. Unfortunately for Zebstrika, it does have poor bulk, meaning it can hardly take a hit, and it is weaker than the other Electric-types. It also has a small movepool; however, its good coverage still allows it to perform its role decently.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Volt Switch is a great way to escape Pokemon that threaten Zebstrika, and is a good way to gain momentum. Thunderbolt doesn't force Zebstrika out and has more power than Volt Switch, so is used as Zebstrika's main STAB move. Overheat hits Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist for super effective damage, but it halves Zebstrika's Special Attack. Hidden Power Grass super effectively hits Rock- and Ground-types, such as Golem and Marowak. Hidden Power Ice can be used to deal more damage to Dragon-types, which otherwise completely wall Zebstrika, such as Fraxure while also hitting Ground-types for super effective damage. It also has the benefit of 2HKOing Torterra without lowering Zebstrika's Special Attack.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Sap Sipper is good for a free immunity; while Zebstrika doesn't take advantage of the boost, it still offers it a useful niche against the Grass-types of the tier, like Tangela. Lightning Rod is a usable option to boost Zebstrika's Special Attack when switching into an Electric-type move. Life Orb boosts Zebstrika's damage output. Expert Belt can be used instead in order to boost the power of super effective moves. Expert Belt is useful for bluffing Choice sets and doesn't deal recoil damage. However, Life Orb is usually preferred over Expert Belt because of its ability to boost the power of all of Zebstrika's moves. Maximum Special Attack makes Zebstrika capable of hitting as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Zebstrika to outrun max Speed Sneasel and beat it with an Overheat.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Zebstrika should be using Volt Switch most of the time to gain momentum and allow you to switch in a Pokemon that can beat the opponent, but watch out for incoming Ground-types. Thunderbolt should only be used to clean up, and should not be spammed when the opponent still has a Ground-type. Aim to switch Zebstrika in on a Grass-type move, as it prevents an ally from getting hurt by it. Don't hesitate to switch out of Ground-types, and only use Hidden Power Water when you predict a Ground-type will switch in. Try to Volt Switch out after using Overheat, which should be used sparingly, as Special Attack is crucial for Zebstrika, and after a Special Attack drop it will be setup bait for a lot of Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Water- or Grass-types that can take care of Ground-types such as Torterra are useful, as Ground-types are immune to Volt Switch and can OHKO Zebstrika. Pokemon that are capable of setting up entry hazards are pretty good partners too, as Zebstrika finds it hard to KO opposing Pokemon easily. For example, Zebstrika can't 2HKO Flareon or Altaria with Thunderbolt without Stealth Rock up, and it will have a higher chance to OHKO Quilladin with Overheat after Stealth Rock. Wallbreakers such as Flareon, Rampardos, and Heatmor that can get rid of special walls allow Zebstrika to clean up. Last but not least, U-turn users such as Frogadier or Purugly are pretty good teammates too, as U-turn and Volt Switch form a good core together.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Choice Scarf can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tauros, but it really prevents Zebstrika from showing off its full potential because it would like to switch moves. Choice Specs can be used for even more power than Life Orb, but when locked into one of its STAB moves, Zebstrika is helpless against Ground-types, which can easily come in and force a switch. Magnet Rise can be used to give Zebstrika an immunity to Ground-type attacks for a few turns. Zebstrika has a usable base 100 Attack, so a physical set can be used, with moves such as Wild Charge, Double-Edge, and Flame Charge, and the ability Sap Sipper boosting Zebstrika's Attack.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon, such as Bastiodon and Lickilicky, can take Zebstrika's hits and stall it out.</p>

<p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Piloswine and Stunfisk threaten Zebstrika; they force it to switch by threatening to OHKO it if it stays in, but they can only come in an Electric-type move safely.</p>

<p><strong>Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Pretty much any powerful offensive Pokemon that can take a hit from Zebstrika can KO it back, as Zebstrika is extremely frail.</p>

<p><strong>Choice Scarf users</strong>: Common Choice Scarf users, such as Tauros, can outspeed Zebstrika and easily KO it.</p>

<p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types, such as Fraxure and Zweilous, resist all of Zebstrika's moves and can KO or set up on it.</p>

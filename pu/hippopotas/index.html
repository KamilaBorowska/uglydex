<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Hippopotas has access to a wide range of support moves, including reliable recovery in Slack Off, and works as a great sand setter and support Pokemon for sand teams due to its ability Sand Stream. The unfortunate thing about using Hippopotas is that sand teams rely on it too much, and it is very predictable in which set it is running due to its lack of versatility, so the opponent is most likely going to know what attacks are coming and be able to play around that. It doesn't enjoy taking a Knock Off, as it relies on Smooth Rock for the extra sand turns. Hippopotas lacks good Special Defense and generally does not carry Eviolite, so it can't take hits from the special side.</p>

<h1>Physically Defensive</h1>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Stealth Rock is a standard entry hazard, which, when combined with the sand, can slowly wear down opposing Pokemon when they switch in. Slack Off provides reliable recovery in order to ensure that Hippopotas is kept at a reasonable amount of health so that it can come in to set up sand later on in the battle. Earthquake is the only attack that Hippopotas needs; it can wear down Pokemon such as Carracosta, Bastiodon, and Metang with Earthquake as well as hit frail Pokemon such as Sneasel and Kadabra on the switch. Whirlwind is used to prevent Pokemon from setting up on Hippopotas. Toxic is an option over Whirlwind if you don't find Pokemon trying to set up too much of an issue and would rather wear down bulky opponents such as Tangela and Misdreavus.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Smooth Rock is the ideal item for Hippopotas because although it is built for taking hits, its main objective is to get up sand in order to support sweepers such as Stoutland, and the extra turns of sand can allow Stoutland to stay in longer rather than be forced to switch. An Impish nature and EVs in HP and Defense ensure that Hippopotas has got as much physical bulk as possible. Sand Stream's sand is used to support the team and to wear down opposing Pokemon to the point where sweepers such as Stoutland can perform a late-game sweep.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Hippopotas isn't very useful on its own. It supports its team by getting up sand and then switching out in order to bring the sand back later on in the battle. Sacrificing Hippopotas near the end of a battle is fine if you're certain that last amount of sand is enough for a Pokemon to clean up. Hippopotas should only use support moves when necessary, such as when predicting a switch; switch out otherwise. Use Stealth Rock to cripple foes as they switch in; however, you should also try to outplay the opponent and double switch so as to not waste sand turns. Hippopotas can take special hits but only to a certain extent; play around the opposing team and be smart when bringing it in on certain Pokemon. Hippopotas should be switched out as soon as possible, as this allows you to get the maximum number of sand turns for your teammates. Earthquake should only be used to finish off weakened opponents and to hit frail Pokemon as they switch in.</p>

<p>Whirlwind is used for threatening opponents that plan on setting up, and Slack Off is for when Hippopotas is low on HP and you need it to set up sand later in the battle. Keeping Hippopotas healthy is essential so that it can be brought in later on to take a hit and get sand up again.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Having Stoutland as a teammate is pretty much mandatory, as without it, Hippopotas is outclassed by other Pokemon. Grass-type Pokemon such as Roselia resist Water- and Grass-type moves. Roselia can also hit Grass-types with Sludge Bomb and set up entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus can prevent your team's hazards from getting removed by Rapid Spin users such as Avalugg.</p>

<p>Water-type Pokemon such as Poliwrath can take Water- and Ice-type attacks and force foes to either switch out or take a hard hit. Lickilicky is a great specially defensive partner, as it can take hits from the special side, something that Hippopotas can't do, as well as deal damage on its own with Body Slam, Knock Off, or even Dragon Tail, forcing more switches. Lickilicky also has access to Heal Bell and Wish, which can be used for supporting the whole team rather than just Hippopotas.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Def is an option for Hippopotas due to it already having a decent Defense stat. This spread allows Hippopotas to survive a special hit or two before fainting rather than just getting OHKOed like it normally would. Yawn is another option for preventing opposing Pokemon from setting up and forcing the opponent to switch, allowing you to gain momentum by double switching. You can use an Eviolite as the item instead of Smooth Rock, as while the extra turns of sand are nice you might decide that you would rather it have the extra bulk in order for it to better take hits and stall.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Mantine don't like to take a Toxic, but they can easily come in on an Earthquake and hit back with Scald, doing a decent amount of damage and potentially crippling Hippopotas with a burn.</p>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Roselia, and Tangela can take an Earthquake with ease, while Roselia can switch in on Toxic too due to its Poison typing. They can also KO Hippopotas with a super effective Giga Drain, which means they will also gain back any damage that was taken upon switching in. Since Hippopotas can't even touch it, Roselia can set up hazards too.</p>

<p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-type Pokemon such as Avalugg and Glaceon can take an Earthquake and fire back with super effective STAB moves; Avalugg has access to Rapid Spin for removing Stealth Rock, while Glaceon has access to Heal Bell for removing status. However, Ice-types have to be more cautious when switching in due to their weakness to Stealth Rock.</p>

<p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Due to Haunter being a Poison-type and having the ability Levitate, Hippopotas can't touch it with either Earthquake or Toxic, giving it a free turn to fire off a Shadow Ball or set up a Substitute. The only way Haunter is taking damage from Hippopotas is from Stealth Rock or the sand.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Taunt users</strong>: Pokemon such as Misdreavus can cripple Hippopotas by stopping it from setting up Stealth Rock or using Toxic with Taunt and then proceeding to fire off their own attacks, eventually making it faint.</p>

<p><strong>Knock Off users</strong>: Pokemon with access to Knock Off, such as Scyther, Lickilicky, and Purugly can Knock Off Hippopotas's Smooth Rock, reducing the number of sand turns that Hippopotas's teammates have to sweep before Hippopotas needs to be brought in again.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entry hazards, most notably Toxic Spikes, limit the number of times that Hippopotas can switch in to set up sand and come back in later on. They also reduce the number of times Hippopotas's teammates can switch in.</p>

<p><strong>Other Weather Teams</strong>: Other weather teams can stop Hippopotas from supporting its own team with sand. When facing Hippopotas, try to preserve your own weather setter until Hippopotas has fainted.</p>

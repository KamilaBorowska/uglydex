<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Avalugg's access to Rapid Spin allows it to support its team by only removing entry hazards on your side while not removing the hazards you have set up, unlike Defog. Avalugg's colossal Defense, along with its high HP stat, allows it to take almost any physical hit with ease, making it a decent check to physical attackers, such as Dodrio and Tauros lacking Fire Blast. A high Attack stat also allows Avalugg to retaliate after being hit, and even without any Attack investment, Avalugg still deals decent damage. Avalugg's reliable recovery in Recover allows it to function as a tank and use Rapid Spin more often.</p>

<p>However, Avalugg's bad defensive typing in Ice grants it many weaknesses and only one resistance, making it vulnerable to many Pokemon. Avalugg's extremely low Speed also makes it very hard to use Rapid Spin effectively, as it usually has to take a hit first. Avalugg's Special Defense is also abysmal, and needs to be invested in to prevent Avalugg from being vulnerable to special attacks. Avalugg also lacks a reliable Ice-type STAB move and has to rely on Avalanche, which requires the opponent to hit Avalugg for any decent damage to be done. Avalugg's weakness to Stealth Rock and vulnerability to Spikes and Toxic Spikes detracts from its role as a spinner, and it also fails to get past most Ghost-types that try to block Rapid Spin, unlike Wartortle, which gets Foresight. Avalugg is a decent spinner in the tier due to it being the bulkiest one with actual offensive presence, and should seriously be considered for any hazard-weak team.</p>

<h1>Rapid Spin</h1>

</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Unlike Defog, Rapid Spin removes hazards on your side of the field while preserving those that you have set on the opposing side of the field. Recover gives Avalugg a form of recovery, which is ideal for a tank, allowing it to use Rapid Spin more often. Avalanche is Avalugg's main STAB attack, stopping it from being Taunt bait and allowing it to mess with opposing Pokemon that attempt to come in. Earthquake is a coverage move that hits Fire-, Rock-, and Steel-type Pokemon super effectively. Roar allows Avalugg to deal with set up sweepers, forcing them out. However, Toxic is an option in the last slot to cripple opposing walls, such as Pelipper.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>248 HP EVs maximize Avalugg's bulk, while minimizing the amount of damage Avalugg takes from Stealth Rock. 252 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature patch up Avalugg's mediocre Special Defense. While all of Avalugg's abilities are relatively useless, Sturdy guarantees Avalugg one Rapid Spin. Holding a Leftovers provides passive recovery. An Impish nature can be used to increase Avalugg's defense a bit and give more insurance against threats such as Iron Tail Tauros and Low Kick Sneasel but using maximum Defense investment is not recommended, as Avalugg will take only marginally less damage from physical attacks, while taking significantly more damage from special attacks.</p>

<p>An alternate spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def with an Adamant nature and a moveset of Rapid Spin, Avalanche, Earthquake or Crunch, and Recover is an option if you'd rather have Avalugg function as an offensive tank with Rapid Spin as a support option. This set could also opt for Crunch over Recover to hit Ghost-type Pokemon that attempt to switch in.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Avalugg is best used staying in and using Rapid Spin when it finds the opportunity, such as against physical attackers that can't do much damage to it. Avalugg is very bulky, but it should not be relied on to take special hits. Keeping Avalugg healthy with Recover, which allows it to use Rapid Spin more often, is key to using it properly. The best time to use Recover is when Avalugg is just above 50% of its health, to benefit from Sturdy. Due to Avalugg's insanely high Defense stat, it can check most physical attackers that don't have a super effective STAB move. Lastly, be very careful when using Rapid Spin if the opponent has a Ghost-type, as Ghost-types are able to block Rapid Spin and can potentially burn Avalugg; instead, try wearing them down with Avalanche.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Avalugg works best on teams that rely on entry hazards yet are weak to them, as Defog users are counterproductive on these teams. Pokemon that patch up Avalugg's weaknesses, such as Poliwrath, make for great partners. Pokemon that benefit from Avalugg's Rapid Spin support, such as Scyther, Dodrio, and Flareon, all make for great partners, and the latter has good defensive synergy with Avalugg. Clerics such as Lickilicky can remove poison and burns, which easily cripple Avalugg. In a similar vein, Poison-types such as Roselia can remove Toxic Spikes, which are usually a problem for Avalugg, while Fire-types such as Flareon can absorb Will-O-Wisp and break through Ghost-types with their STAB moves. Roselia and Flareon are also able to take strong special hits, which threaten Avalugg.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>While using an offensive tank set with three attacks and Recover seems appealing, the loss of Rapid Spin is very detrimental, as it is one of Avalugg's biggest niches. Mirror Coat with Sturdy is an option to gain surprise KOs on special attackers. Lastly, a physically defensive EV spread is not beneficial, as Avalugg will only take about 10% less damage from physical attacks, at the cost of taking about 30% more damage from special attacks.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Bulky Ghost-types</strong>: Most bulky Ghost-types are a problem for Avalugg. Gourgeist-XL can tank any attack from Avalugg and burn it. Misdreavus can burn Avalugg or set up on it. Haunter can Trick its Choice Scarf to Avalugg, or take advantage of its low Special Defense; it cannot safely switch in on Avalugg due to its poor bulk though. Ghost-types also block Rapid Spin, stopping one of Avalugg's main niches.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most Fighting-types can tank Avalugg's attacks and outlast it or wear it down. Physically defensive Poliwrath resists Avalanche, doesn't take much from Earthquake, and can hit Avalugg very hard. Substitute variants block Toxic and can use Bulk Up or Focus Punch to beat Avalugg. Throh can also set up Bulk Up, remove Avalugg's Leftovers with Knock Off, and threaten Avalugg with its Fighting STAB.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt</strong>: If Avalugg is hit by Taunt, it loses the ability to use Recover, Roar, and Toxic, which makes it harder to function as a wall and forces it to rely on Avalanche and Earthquake if it chooses to stay in; examples of Taunt users include Misdreavus and Murkrow.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Like most walls, Avalugg is easily worn down by burn and poison. Toxic from Pokemon such as Pelipper is especially troublesome for Avalugg, due to its damage stacking up and eventually bringing Avalugg down. Burns from Pokemon such as Misdreavus reduce Avalugg's offensive presence and negate Leftovers recovery. Avalugg is also threatened by common Pokemon that it normally walls but occasionally carry Toxic, such as Piloswine. Toxic Spikes is also a problem, as it poisons Avalugg while it attempts to spin them away.</p>

<p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick users such as Rotom-F can easily cripple Avalugg with a Choice item, which will lock Avalugg into an undesired move such as Rapid Spin or Recover and will generally render it useless.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Even with Special Defense investment, most special Fire-types, such as Ninetales, can break through Avalugg. Powerful physical Fire-types, such as Flareon, can also heavily dent Avalugg despite its high base Defense. However, Earthquake does hit them very hard.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Ninetales is the best Fire-type in PU, acting as a threatening sweeper with its great Speed and access to the elusive boosting move Nasty Plot. With its great coverage, good power, and above-average Speed, Ninetales is capable of sweeping through teams with ease. However, Ninetales is troubled by common special walls in PU, particularly Lickilicky; is outsped and revenge killed by common Pokemon such as Tauros, Sneasel, Simipour, and Raichu; and is worn down easily due to its low physical bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock.</p>

<h1>Nasty Plot</h1>

<div class=set>
    Ninetales @ Life Orb / Leftovers / Passho Berry<br>
    Ability: Flash Fire<br>
    EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Nasty Plot<br>- Fire Blast / Flamethrower<br>- Psyshock<br>- Energy Ball
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Nasty Plot lets Ninetales function as a threatening late-game sweeper. Fire Blast is a very strong STAB move that makes up for Ninetales's average Special Attack stat, but Flamethrower is a viable option as well if better accuracy and higher PP are preferred. Psyshock is useful for getting past Pokemon such as Throh and opposing Fire-types, and Energy Ball rounds off Ninetales's coverage by smacking Rock- and Water-types such as Poliwrath, Golem, and Barbaracle.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Life Orb gives Ninetales quite a bit of power in exchange for longevity, while Leftovers does the opposite. Passho Berry lets Ninetales avoid being revenge killed by Aqua Jet users such as Carracosta and Basculin and faster Water-types such as Simipour. The given EV spread is standard for a special attacker, and Flash Fire is helpful for pivoting into other Fire-types and forcing them out.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Set up on something Ninetales forces out, such as Roselia. Thanks to Ninetales's good special bulk, it can switch into special attackers that it has a type advantage against, such as Clefairy and Tangela, quite easily, though it must be wary of Sleep Powder from the latter. If Ninetales can't set up, just spam Fire Blast unless the opponent has a Flash Fire Pokemon, in which case Psyshock is your best option as it 2HKOes every Flash Fire user in PU with Stealth Rock up.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Wallbreakers such as Marowak, Chatot, and Life Orb Tauros can help open holes in the opposing team to let Ninetales sweep more easily. Pokemon that can switch into Water-types and revenge killers are helpful; Poliwrath in particular beats most Water-types and Sneasel. Strong special attackers such as Simipour and Heatmor can help wear down walls such as Lickilicky. Sticky Web support is useful for Ninetales as it prevents Ninetales from being revenge killed by the likes of Sneasel, non-Choice Scarf Tauros, and Simipour.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Ninetales can use Substitute over Psyshock or Energy Ball on the Nasty Plot set, as Ninetales forces a decent number of switches. More defensively oriented sets with Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split are viable, as is a Substitute + Pain Split set.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Sneasel, Tauros, Simipour and Purugly can outspeed and dispatch of Ninetales even if it has set up, as can Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Mr. Mime, Haunter, and Rotom-F. Aqua Jet users such as Carracosta and Basculin can also revenge kill it, but they fail to do so if Ninetales carries a Passho Berry.</p>

<p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Ninetales's great coverage and good power mean that it is difficult to wall. However, Lickilicky and the rare Munchlax can wall even a Ninetales that has set up, and Pokemon such as Pelipper and Bastiodon do a decent job of taking it on before it has set up.</p>

<p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Ninetales's weakness to Stealth Rock, vulnerability to Spikes, and possible Life Orb recoil can wear it down rather quickly. It can also be worn down quite easily by Toxic from Pokemon such as Pelipper.</p>

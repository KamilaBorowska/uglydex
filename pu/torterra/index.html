<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Torterra is one of the best Pokemon in PU thanks to its solid dual STAB combination. Torterra sets itself apart from other Stealth Rock users in the tier with its access to reliable recovery, which allows it to set up Stealth Rock multiple times if need be, and its ability to beat common Stealth Rock setters such as Golem and Barbaracle one-on-one. Torterra's Grass / Ground typing also allows it to take on physical Water-types better than Pokemon such as Piloswine can while providing resistances to Rock and Ground and an immunity to Electric. At the same time, Torterra can handle common physical attackers such as Pawniard. Torterra's versatility allows it to function on a lot of teams. However, Torterra's typing does leave it weak to common types such as Fire, Flying, and especially Ice.</p>

<h1>Offensive Stealth Rock</h1>

<div class=set>
    Torterra @ Leftovers / Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Overgrow<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Stealth Rock<br>- Bullet Seed<br>- Earthquake<br>- Synthesis / Stone Edge
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Stealth Rock is great for all teams, as it damages foes switching in. Bullet Seed allows Torterra to bypass leads with Sturdy or Focus Sash such as Golem and Barbaracle, respectively. Earthquake smacks Fire-types such as Flareon and Ninetales, which resist Bullet Seed. Synthesis gives Torterra a reliable method of recovery so that it can take hits and set up Stealth Rock again if needed. Stone Edge is an option to nail Flying-types such as Togetic, Ninjask, and Dodrio, which resist Bullet Seed and are immune to Earthquake.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Attack investment allows Torterra to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Torterra to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, especially Dwebble and Pawniard. Leftovers gives Torterra passive recovery and more staying power. However, Life Orb can be used to increase Torterra's damage output. Torterra's ability, Overgrow, boosts the power of Bullet Seed when Torterra's HP becomes low.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Torterra's typing allows it to beat other Stealth Rock leads one-on-one, so it is best to take advantage of the fact and set up Stealth Rock when the moment comes. This doesn't mean that you have to lead with Torterra all the time. While Torterra's main priority is to set up Stealth Rock for its teammates, faster entry hazard setters with access to Taunt, such as Barbaracle and Kricketune, can stop Torterra from setting up its entry hazards, but neither of them appreciates their Focus Sash being broken, especially the former.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>This set is best used on balanced or hyper offense teams. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir block Rapid Spin and keep Stealth Rock on the opponent's side of the field. Water-types such as Carracosta and Poliwrath are good partners for Torterra, as they both resist Ice and Fire for Torterra, while Torterra can switch in on Electric-type attacks aimed at them. The former also resists Flying-type attacks for Torterra. Setup sweepers such as Ninetales and Barbaracle appreciate Torterra's Stealth Rock support, as it helps them potentially sweep. Defiant users such as Purugly and Pawniard work well with Torterra, as they discourage foes from using Defog.</p>

<h1>Tank</h1>

<div class=set>
    Torterra @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Overgrow<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Wood Hammer<br>- Earthquake<br>- Synthesis<br>- Stealth Rock
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Wood Hammer hits Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types such as Golem, Carracosta, Poliwrath, and Marowak. Earthquake hits Fire- and Steel-types which resist Wood Hammer, such as Flareon and Pawniard. Synthesis provides Torterra with a reliable method of recovery from attacks or from Wood Hammer recoil. Stealth Rock is greatly appreciated on any team, as it wears down foes switching in.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum HP investment allows Torterra to be as bulky as possible to take hits. Maximum Attack investment allows Torterra to hit as hard as possible. A physically defensive spread is an option, with maximum Defense investment and an Impish nature, but Torterra misses out on getting guaranteed OHKOs on Pokemon such as Pawniard. Leftovers gives Torterra passive recovery. Overgrow is the preferred ability, as it boosts the power of Torterra's Grass-type STAB moves.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Because of Torterra's STAB combination, it can force switches against other Stealth Rock setters such as Golem and Barbaracle and proceed to set up its own Stealth Rock. Switch Torterra in on attacks that it resists, such as Rock- and Ground-type attacks, or on a predicted Electric-type attack. Use Synthesis when Torterra's HP falls to 50% or lower, but be mindful of Synthesis's low PP. Opposing Pokemon that resist or are immune to Torterra's STAB combination, such as Gogoat, Tangela, Haunter, and Gourgeist, can give Torterra unfavorable matchups, so it's best to keep this in mind.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>This set is best suited for balanced or bulky offense teams. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Dusclops block Rapid Spin and keep Stealth Rock on the opponent's side of the field. Defiant users such as Pawniard and Purugly work well with Torterra, as they stop foes from using Defog. Steel- and Electric-types such as Probopass and Zebstrika can handle Flying-types for Torterra while Torterra can handle Ground-types for them. Water-types such as Carracosta and Poliwrath are good teammates for Torterra, as they both resist Ice and Fire. The former also resists Flying for Torterra. Setup sweepers such as Ninetales and Barbaracle appreciate Torterra's Stealth Rock support, as it helps them potentially sweep. Thick Fat Grumpig aids Torterra, taking Fire- and Ice-type attacks aimed at it.</p>

<h1>Rock Polish</h1>

<div class=set>
    Torterra @ Life Orb / Yache Berry<br>
    Ability: Overgrow<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Adamant / Jolly Nature<br>
    - Rock Polish<br>- Wood Hammer / Seed Bomb<br>- Earthquake<br>- Stone Edge
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Rock Polish increases Torterra's below-average Speed to respectable levels, letting it outspeed most Pokemon in the tier. Wood Hammer smacks Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types such as Golem, Carracosta, Poliwrath, and Marowak. Seed Bomb is an option over Wood Hammer, as it doesn't inflict recoil damage and still gets boosted by STAB, although Torterra will miss out on OHKOing Piloswine with Wood Hammer after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake is Torterra's main STAB attack for hitting Fire- and Steel-types that resist Wood Hammer, such as Flareon, Ninetales, and Pawniard. Stone Edge provides great coverage for Torterra, as it hits Flying-types such as Dodrio, Ninjask, and Togetic, which resist and are immune to Torterra's STAB combination.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature allow Torterra to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment allows Torterra to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, especially after a Rock Polish. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Mr. Mime after a Rock Polish. Life Orb is the preferred item to increase Torterra's damage output. Yache Berry is also an option, as it allows Torterra to survive Piloswine's Ice Shard and Rotom-F's Hidden Power Ice as well as reliably set up on Water-types that carry Ice-type coverage, such as Poliwrath, Golduck, and Simipour. Overgrow is the preferred ability, boosting Torterra's Grass-type STAB moves when its HP is low.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Use Rock Polish on Pokemon Torterra can force out such as Golem and Carracosta, Pokemon that can't do much to Torterra, or faster offensive teams that can threaten Torterra. Try to set up only when Torterra's checks and counters have been removed or weakened enough for Torterra to take them out on its own. If running Wood Hammer, use it sparingly, as the recoil combined with Life Orb recoil will wear down Torterra faster. Torterra can be used early in the match to wear down checks and counters and then return mid- or late-game to set up Rock Polish to finish off weakened foes.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Fire-types such as Ninetales and Rapidash are good teammates for Torterra, as they take care of Grass-types for Torterra and resist Ice-type attacks. Wallbreakers, such as Ursaring and Simipour, aid Torterra in weakening or getting rid of Grass-types. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Barbaracle, Probopass, and Carracosta helps wear down Torterra's checks and counters, making it easier for Torterra to sweep. Special Poliwrath is a good partner for Torterra, as it baits in Grass-types that Torterra has trouble getting past and hits them with Ice Beam. It also lures in Electric-types for Torterra and beats Piloswine, allowing Torterra to set up easily. Pokemon with access to Volt Switch or U-turn such as Raichu, Rotom-F, and Ninjask work well with Torterra, as they can use their momentum to bring Torterra in on an attack Torterra resists or is immune to.</p>

<h1>Choice Band</h1>

<div class=set>
    Torterra @ Choice Band<br>
    Ability: Overgrow<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Wood Hammer<br>- Earthquake<br>- Stone Edge<br>- Bullet Seed / Crunch
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Wood Hammer is Torterra's most powerful Grass-type STAB move, nailing Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types such as Golem, Carracosta, Poliwrath, and Marowak. Earthquake allows Torterra to handle Fire- and Steel-types that resist Wood Hammer such as Rapidash and Pawniard. Stone Edge hits Flying-types, such as Ninjask, Togetic, and Dodrio, which resist Wood Hammer and are immune to Earthquake. Bullet Seed can be used to break through Pokemon with Sturdy and Focus Sash leads, such as Golem and Barbaracle, while not having to worry about Wood Hammer's recoil, although the damage isn't as reliable as Wood Hammer's. Crunch is an option over Bullet Seed, as it hits Ghost-types such as Gourgeist, Misdreavus, and Dusknoir super effectively.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature are used to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment lets Torterra outspeed as many threats as possible. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Pawniard, as well as Adamant maximum Speed base 65 Pokemon such as Flareon and Heatmor. Overgrow is the preferred ability, giving a significant boost to Torterra's Grass-type moves in a pinch. Choice Band increases Torterra's Attack stat to incredible levels, allowing it do dish out more damage.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Use Torterra's defensive typing to switch it into resisted or Electric-type attacks. Earthquake is the safer attack to use if the opponent doesn't have a Flying-type or a Levitate user. Be cautious of what attack Torterra locks itself into using, as your opponent can take advantage of this and get a free turn. Bullet Seed should be used only as an anti-lead function against Sturdy users, such as Golem, or against Pokemon that normally carry Focus Sash, such as Barbaracle.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Setup sweepers such as Barbaracle, Ninetales, and Carracosta are good partners to take advantage of Torterra's wallbreaking ability. Ninetales also aids Torterra in handling Grass- and Ice-types. Volt Switch and U-turn users, such as Raichu, Rotom-F, and Probopass make for good partners for Torterra for their ability to gain momentum while bringing Torterra in on a resisted or Electric-type attack. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Probopass, Carracosta, and Barbaracle is very useful in helping to wear down Torterra's switch-ins. Sticky Web or paralysis support from Pokemon such as Leavanny, Kricketune, and Grumpig can slow down faster foes for Torterra to outspeed and dent with its attacks. Torterra can also benefit from Trick Room support from Pokemon such as Beheeyem and Carbink. If Torterra is to be played under the effects of Trick Room, ensure that it has a Brave nature, 0 Speed EVs, and 0 Speed IVs.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Roar is an option on the Tank set to phaze foes, especially setup sweepers, while racking up entry hazard damage. Toxic can be used to cripple Grass-types such as Gourgeist, Tangela, and opposing Torterra. Swords Dance is an option over Stone Edge on the Rock Polish set, as it allows Torterra to pressure more defensively oriented teams at the cost of additional coverage. A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD with a Careful nature is also viable, as it allows Torterra to better handle Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika as well as other special attackers such as Kadabra, Probopass, and Tangela.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types, such as Tangela and Gourgeist, can take hits from Torterra fairly well, and the latter fears Crunch alone from the Choice Band set while it can cripple Torterra with Will-O-Wisp. Also, Tangela often carries Hidden Power Ice, which threatens Torterra. Quilladin can tank all of Torterra's attacks, heal off damage with Synthesis, and proceed to set up Spikes. Gogoat can switch in on a predicted Grass-type move, get an Attack boost from Sap Sipper, and proceed to set up with Bulk Up or get off a free Substitute.</p>

<p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types, such as Rotom-F and Piloswine, threaten to KO Torterra with their STAB moves but cannot switch in easily. The latter also carries Ice Shard, which can threaten the Rock Polish variant. Aurorus outspeeds Torterra and can KO it with Refrigerate Hyper Voice.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types, such as Flareon, Ninetales, and Heatmor, resist Wood Hammer and can easily KO Torterra with their respective STAB moves but cannot switch in on Earthquake.</p>

<p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types, such as Dodrio and Jumpluff, are immune to Earthquake and usually resist Wood Hammer. However, they must watch out for Stone Edge on the switch.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Will-O-Wisp halves Torterra's Attack, rendering it useless, while Toxic puts a timer on Torterra's longevity.</p>

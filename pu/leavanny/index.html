<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Leavanny can use Sticky Web, which provides helpful speed control, and has advantages over the other Sticky Web users in the PU tier. Despite Leavanny's average attacking stats, it still has some offensive presence, something other Sticky Web users such as Kricketune lack. Leavanny's base 92 Speed gives it a decent Speed tier, allowing Leavanny to outspeed many Taunt users, and Magic Coat can reflect faster Taunts as well as other entry hazards. However, Leavanny's defenses and defensive typing leave much to be desired, and prevent it from having a role other than being a Sticky Web suicide lead.</p>

<h1>Suicide Lead</h1>

<div class=set>
    Leavanny @ Focus Sash<br>
    Ability: Overcoat<br>
    EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Naive Nature<br>
    - Sticky Web<br>- Leaf Storm<br>- Knock Off<br>- Magic Coat
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Sticky Web provides speed control, giving Leavanny its niche. Leaf Storm can hit common physically bulky leads such as Barbaracle and Golem hard, though they might be holding a Focus Sash; the Special Attack drop is insignificant due to Leavanny's short lifespan. Knock Off removes the target's item and is a more spammable move that can target Eviolite users such as Tangela and Misdreavus. Magic Coat is used to reflect back Taunt and entry hazards from opposing leads.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>252 Speed EVs and a Naive nature maximize Leavanny's Speed and 252 Special Attack EVs boost the power of Leaf Storm. A Focus Sash makes sure that Leavanny will survive a hit and set up Sticky Web.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Almost always lead with Leavanny, though it is not necessary to do so if the opponent's team has ways of removing entry hazards, because Leavanny's good Speed means it can still find openings later on in the game to set up Sticky Web. Usually, Leavanny should set up Sticky Web first and then attack or use Magic Coat, although you should use Magic Coat to reflect Taunt from faster Taunt users such as Sneasel or against slower leads that cannot bring you down to your Focus Sash such as Kriketune. It is also a good idea to use Magic Coat if you have Sticky Web up and your opponent has not yet set up entry hazards. Use Knock Off against Golem before using Leaf Storm, as Golem will survive it beforehand, and you can avoid losing to Sturdy Weakness Policy Golem. Be especially careful of using Magic Coat on Golem and Piloswine, as they can both KO Leavanny turn one, and as a result prevent it from setting up Sticky Web. After setting up Sticky Web, don't be afraid to fodder Leavanny by spamming Magic Coat to prevent hazards from going up on your side. Finally, Leavanny should repeatedly use Sticky Web against Defoggers such as Swanna, because it guarantees that Sticky Web will be up.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Leavanny works best with teammates that are slow but can hit hard, such as Flareon, Aurorus, and Marowak. Spinblockers, such as Haunter and Misdreavus, can stop opposing Rapid Spin users from removing Sticky Web. Pokemon with the ability Defiant or Competitive, such as Purugly and Wigglytuff respectively, can discourage the use of Defog, as it would boost their stats, and the latter can use Stealth Rock to provide more team support. Leavanny should only be used on offensive teams, as they can pressure the opposing team more with the help of Sticky Web's speed control, and they make it harder for the foes to find an opening to remove Sticky Web. Offensive entry hazard setters such as Rampardos and Marowak can use Stealth Rock to gain crucial chip damage and add even more pressure to your opponent. A fast safety net such as Choice Scarf Rotom-F or Tauros can be used as insurance for if Sticky Web is removed or your opponent has Flying-types or Levitating Pokemon, which are immune to Sticky Web.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Leaf Blade is more reliable than Leaf Storm, as it does not come with stat drops or imperfect accuracy, but Leaf Storm hits almost all leads harder. Swords Dance on sun teams with Chlorophyll is possible, but it is still very hard for Leavanny to sweep, and this role is filled more reliably by Victreebel. Grass Whistle is an option to put opposing leads to sleep, but its accuracy is too unreliable. Bug Buzz is also an option to target Tangela and Leafeon. A Baton Pass set with Swords Dance can be used but is not recommended due to Leavanny's frailty and bad defensive typing.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Defog Users</strong>: Swanna can KO Leavanny with its Flying-type STAB moves and use Defog to remove Sticky Web, and more defensive Defoggers such as Prinplup, Pelipper, and Togetic also can find openings to Defog against Leavanny.</p>

<p><strong>Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Wartortle and Avalugg can use Rapid Spin to remove Sticky Web, although the latter can be stopped by spinblockers.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Grounded Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Dodrio and Swanna are unaffected by Sticky Web, meaning they usually have higher Speed than much of Leavanny's team, and can inflict heavy damage.</p>

<p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bulky setup sweepers such as Ninetales and Fraxure that do not mind Leaf Storm can set up on Leavanny.</p>

<p><strong>Purugly</strong>: Purugly can Fake Out to stop Leavanny setting Sticky Web, and can also take advantage of Sticky Web to get a +2 Attack boost from Defiant.</p>

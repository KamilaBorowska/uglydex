<p>Sceptile gains additional Dragon typing after Mega Evolution, giving it a unique and powerful STAB combination in the form of Leaf Storm and Dragon Pulse. Additionally, it also gains Lightning Rod, enabling it to absorb and benefit from the ubiquitous Electric-type moves in Doubles. Notably, Mega Sceptile can make a decent offensive core with Electric-type teammates, as it can absorb Discharge and provides spectacular coverage against Ground- and Dragon-types. While Leaf Storm is the most powerful attack on this set, it must be used with caution as it sharply drops Sceptile's offense and can force it to switch out. Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire further improve Mega Sceptile's coverage, especially against Steel-types. The former is more powerful and hits Heatran super effectively, while the latter is a more effective and accurate option against the likes of Ferrothorn and Scizor. As usual in Doubles, Protect is mandatory in that it offers a method of scouting against Fake Out and other predicted attacks, while enabling Sceptile to Mega Evolve to its faster and more powerful form safely. The given spread allows Mega Sceptile to outrun max Speed Shaymin-S while maintaining a considerable amount of offense.</p>

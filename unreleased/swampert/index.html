<p>With its new Mega Evolution, Swampert is finally a Pokemon that can be a dominating factor in the metagame. Base 150 Attack in tandem with 100/110/110 defenses makes Swampert a very threatening tank. Being able to hit nearly every common Pokemon for super effective damage with the correct set also helps. Waterfall is always going to be Swampert's main STAB, with Earthquake and an Ice-type move providing it with near perfect coverage. Superpower can also be used to hit Pokemon like Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn.</p>

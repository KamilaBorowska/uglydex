    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>

    - High Jump Kick<br>- Return<br>- Healing Wish<br>- Ice Punch / Thunder Punch / Substitute 
</div>

<p>Lopunny is back and ready to dish out the pain with its new Mega Evolution. Its newly available High Jump Kick is a staple for the set and is an absolute nuke, especially considering the STAB boost it picks up in the transition. Return is the secondary STAB move that nails Fighting-resistant Pokemon. Healing Wish is invaluable for bulky offense and balance teams, as it gives a teammate a chance to come back out swinging after Mega Lopunny's usefulness has expired. Ice Punch hits Gliscor/Gligar as well as Dragon-types hard, Thunder Punch handles Gyarados, and Substitute can be used to avoid status moves or take advantage of an opponent's switch. The absolute best part of Mega Lopunny's offensive prowess is the addition of the Scrappy ability, which allows it to spam High Jump Kick freely regardless of any Ghost-types the opponent may have.</p>

<h1>Set</h1>

<div class=set>
    Lopunny @ Lopunnyite<br>
    Ability: Limber<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Fake Out<br>- Return<br>- Low Kick / High Jump Kick<br>- Encore / Protect
</div>

<p>With Scrappy enabling Mega Lopunny to hit Ghost-types, as well as a quick base 105 Speed prior to Mega Evolution, Lopunny is one of the better Fake Out leads in the Doubles metagame. Fake Out also grants a safe turn to Mega Evolve, after which it gains nearly unmatched Speed, decent offensive typing, and great (albeit unboosted) offense to batter the opposition. Return and the chosen Fighting-type move of choice offer unresisted coverage thanks to Scrappy while being boosted by STAB. While High Jump Kick may seem obvious because it offers consistent and extremely powerful damage output, Low Kick is simply more reliable in Doubles, as many opponents can exploit High Jump Kick by spamming Protect. However, Lopunny can turn the tables against Protect (and Fake Out to an extent) users by using its super fast Encore, leaving them utterly crippled and unable to attack properly. Alternatively, Protect is useful to scout for incoming assault, as well as shield it from opposing Fake Outs and stall out field conditions such as rain and Trick Room.</p>

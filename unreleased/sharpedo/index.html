<p>Mega Sharpedo is one of the new Mega Evolutions that can actually benefit immediately from their original form's ability. Using Protect while in Sharpedo's original form nets it a nice boost in Speed, and it can then Mega Evolve and wreak havoc. Crunch with STAB and Strong Jaw factored in comes out to be an obscenely powerful 180 Base Power move. Waterfall is the obligatory Water-type STAB attack which is sometime capable of flinching the opponent, something that Sharpedo's boosted Speed will be able to take advantage of very well, though Hydro Pump may come in handy for hitting enemies that are weaker on the special side. Ice Fang reaps the Strong Jaw boost as well, and provides good coverage alongside Waterfall, while Zen Headbutt offers a nice super effective hit against the Fighting-types that resist Crunch. Adamant nature is used here over Jolly because Protect and Speed Boost allow Sharpedo a free boost in Speed regardless of anything, but Naughty can be used if Hydro Pump is preferred over Waterfall, so that its power is not cut back by a negative nature.</p>

<div class=set>
    Diancie @ Diancite<br>
    Ability: Clear Body<br>
    EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Naive / Hasty Nature<br>
    - Moonblast<br>- Diamond Storm<br>- Earth Power<br>- Hidden Power Fire / Stealth Rock
</div>

<p>Pretty straightforward all out attacker or offensive Stealth Rock setter. Max SpA is good as most of your moves are special, and you want to hit Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross as hard as possible on the switch, but max Atk has merits in order to 2HKO Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, 30% chance to 2HKO 4 HP / 252 Def+ Chansey after Stealth Rock, and 2HKO Stealth Rock Clefable. Naive is preffered to check Talonflame, Mega Altaria, and Mega Charizard X better, but Hasty is ok to tank Surf and Thunderbolt from Latios and Latias easier.</p>

<div class=set>
    Diancie @ Diancite<br>
    Ability: Clear Body<br>
    EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Naive / Timid Nature<br>
    - Calm Mind<br>- Moonblast<br>- Earth Power / Hidden Power Fire<br>- Diamond Storm / Hidden Power Fire / Psyshock
</div>

<p>Diancie has enough Speed and power to make use of Calm Mind, and Magic Bounce prevents any status moves from ruining its setup, which can make it difficult to stop. Moonblast is Diancie's obligatory Fairy-type STAB attack, and Earth Power hits all three Fairy-resistant types for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire is an option on the set specifically for getting a big hit against Scizor and Ferrothorn. Diamond Storm is Diancie's physical Rock-type STAB move, which hurts special walls and makes sure Ho-Oh doesn't wall the set. Psyshock is also nice for hitting Arceus-Poison as well as Gengar before it Mega evolves. Naive nature should be used if Diamond Storm is in the fourth slot, so as to maintain decent physical offense with this attack; Timid nature can be used if Diamond Storm is not included.</p>

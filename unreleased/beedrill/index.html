<p>Beedrill's Attack and Speed increase drastically upon Mega Evolution, turning what is arguably one of the worst Pokemon in the game into a terrifying glass cannon with the stats and ability to make its attacks really sting. Protect is obligatory on the set to allow Beedrill to Mega Evolve and gain all its buffs without being attacked. Adaptability-boosted STAB U-turn hits obscenely hard on top of keeping up momentum and punishing switches, and knocks anything weak to Bug for a huge loop. Poison Jab is the secondary STAB attack on the set and it hits the Fairy-types that resist Bug for super effective damage. Drill Run is the primary coverage option here for nailing the Steel-types that wall both of Beedrill's STAB moves, but Knock Off is an alternative option for hitting Ghost-types as well as removing items from enemies.</p>

<div class=set>
    Salamence @ Salamenceite<br>

    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Naive / Jolly Nature<br>
    - Dragon Dance<br>- Return / Double-Edge<br>- Earthquake<br>- Fire Blast / Outrage
</div>

<p>Dragon Dance Mega Salamence is capable of sweeping entire teams after a single boost, and finds plenty of setup chances thanks to Intimidate and great overall bulk. Return or Double-Edge are the primary STAB and destroy anything that doesn't resist it or doesn't have ridiculous physical bulk. Earthquake covers Rock- and Steel-types, such as Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, Jirachi, Heatran, Magnezone, and Bisharp. Fire Blast covers Ferrothorn, Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory, Outrage takes care of Rotom-W and has a good chance to OHKO even physically defensive variants after Stealth Rock and an Adamant nature, but keep in mind that +1 Double-Edge already does around half to Rotom-W, as Outrage is useless outside of dealing with Rotom-W, and has a very nasty side effect, which will probably cause Mega Salamence to get revenge killed by a Choice Scarf user, a priority user, a Steel-, or a Fairy-type.</p>

<div class=set>
    Salamence @ Salamenceite<br>

    EVs: 252 SpA / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid / Naive Nature<br>
    - Hyper Voice<br>- Fire Blast<br>- Draco Meteor / Earthquake<br>- Roost / Double-Edge / Earthquake
</div>

<p>This set takes advantage of the very spammable Hyper Voice, which can surprise usual answers to Mega Salamence, such as Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Mega Metagross. Fire Blast covers Steel-types, and Draco Meteor is Mega Salamence's strongest move and a great revenge killing tool, considering Mega Salamence outspeeds all the common Dragon-types in OU. Earthquake covers Heatran, specially defensive Jirachi, Mega Diancie, Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, and Empoleon, all Pokemon that would counter Mega Salamence otherwise. Roost enhances Mega Salamence's survivability and lets it take advantage of its great bulk and somewhat offset the Stealth Rock weakness, while Double-Edge helps get past special walls, such as Chansey, Mew, and Cresselia, 2HKOing all of them with the help of Stealth Rock.</p>

<div class=set>
    Salamence @ Salamenceite<br>

    EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpD<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Dragon Dance<br>- Return / Facade<br>- Roost <br>- Refresh / Earthquake
</div>

<p>This set takes a bulky approach to Mega Salamence and aims to shut down checks and counters that rely on status to deal with it, such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Mega Slowbro, or just by chiping away at its health little by little. With the investment in special bulk, Mega Salamence can set up on a plethora of Pokemon it couldn't before, such as Gengar, Mega Charizard Y, Ice Beam Slowbro, Hidden Power Ice Rotom-W, and Mega Manectric, as well as check Mega Charizard Y. Refresh cures any status and coupled with Roost, makes sure that very few defensive Pokemon can beat Mega Salamence, making it a potent wallbreaker. Facade is an option over Return, enabling Mega Salamence to not care about burns while having an additional slot for Earthquake, a very important coverage move for checks such as Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, Mega Metagross, and Mega Diancie.
How to destroy Stall/Balance: the set. Very bulky, and dgaf about status.</p>

<h1>Set</h1>

<div class=set>
    Salamence @ Salamenceite<br>
    Ability: Intimidate<br>
    EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Dragon Dance<br>- Double-Edge / Return<br>- Earthquake / Aqua Tail<br>- Protect
</div>

<p>Salamence finally gets to harness its high Attack with Dragon Dance, thanks to finally having a reliable STAB. Intimidate users are not reliable switchins thanks to its ridiculous power</p>

<ul>
<li>252+ Atk Aerilate Salamence Double-Edge vs. 4 HP  / 0 Def Landorus-T: 331-391 (103.4 - 122.1%) -- guaranteed OHKO</li>
<li>252+ Atk Aerilate Salamence Double-Edge vs. 252 HP  / 0 Def Gyarados: 369-435 (93.6 - 110.4%) -- 62.5% chance to OHKO</li>
</ul>

<p>The only fairly reliable Intimidate switchin is Mawile, who still takes a hefty chunk from Earthquake:</p>

<ul>
<li>-1 252+ Atk Salamence Earthquake vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Mawile: 148-176 (48.6 - 57.8%) -- 96.1% chance to 2HKO</li>
</ul>

<p>Ground covers Flying extremely well, hitting all of its resists (Steel, Rock, and Electric) for Super Effective. However, because of spread reduction, it is actually kind of weak. If you don't want the risk of hitting your partner, Aqua Tail provides actually slightly better coverage (hitting a couple notable targets, like Thundurus) and power (OHKOing Scarf Tyranitar while Earthquake does not) but does not hit Steel- or Electric-types Super Effectively.</p>

<h1>Set</h1>

<div class=set>
    Salamence @ Salamenceite<br>



    - Hyper Voice<br>- Fire Blast / Hydro Pump<br>- Draco Meteor<br>- Protect
</div>

<p>Mega Salamence is a considerable threat in Doubles. It can grab momentum easily with Intimidate pre-Mega Evolving, its great offensive and defensive typing, and a great base 120 Speed post-Mega Evolving that outspeeds many Doubles threats. Although it's no Sylveon's Choice Specs Hyper Voice, Mega Salamence's Aerialate-boosted Hyper Voice offers a solid spread attack that greatly limits any switch-ins. If something does switch in safely, that Pokemon will also have to deal with Draco Meteor or some powerful coverage attacks.</p>

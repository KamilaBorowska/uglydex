<div class=set>
    Groudon @ Red Orb<br>

    EVs: 128 HP / 252 Atk / 128 Spe<br>
    Adamant / Naughty Nature<br>
    - Rock Polish<br>- Precipice Blades / Earthquake<br>- Stone Edge / Fire Punch<br>- Overheat / Swords Dance / Fire Punch
</div>

<p>Primal Groudon makes for a viable user of Rock Polish, as shown in this offensive set. 128 Speed EVs are necessary to outspeed Choice Scarf users with base 100 Speed after a Rock Polish boost, which will allow Groudon to sweep more easily without being deterred by speedy attackers. Precipice Blades is the obligatory STAB attack here, which is extremely powerful, but Earthquake can be used as an alternative for perfect accuracy but with a bit less power. Stone Edge provides great coverage alongside Primal Groudon's Ground-type STAB, and Fire Punch is a sun-boosted option with a newfound STAB bonus due to the Primal form's Fire typing. STAB sun-boosted Overheat from base 150 Special Attack totally annihilates Gliscor and Landorus-T, two Pokemon which would serve as reliable checks if it doesn't carry it, but Swords Dance can be used to heighten its already colossal Attack power through the roof and out of the chimney, giving this set a double dance approach. Naughty is the nature of choice here if Overheat is used, as to not take away from Primal Groudon's damage output with it, but Adamant is the optimal choice if Overheat is not included.</p>

<div class=set>
    Groudon @ Red Orb<br>

    EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD<br>
    Careful Nature<br>
    - Stealth Rock<br>- Precipice Blades<br>- Rock Slide / Lava Plume<br>- Thunder Wave / Roar / Toxic
</div>

<p>This set takes a specially defensive approach and fills the role of a supporter that can also dish out decent damage. Careful nature with maximum special bulk allows Primal Groudon to counter Primal Kyogre, which only has a 30.6% chance to 3HKO with Ice Beam and 40.2% chance to 3HKO with HP Ground after Stealth Rock. Primal Groudon runs Stealth Rock on this set to support its team and assist both itself and its comrades with getting KOs. Precipice Blades wrecks standard Dialga, and Primal Groudon takes less than 50% from +2 Moonblast from Xerneas, while Precipice Blades deals over half back to Xerneas even with no Attack investment, so Groudon can easily overwhelm, cripple, or phaze it out. Rock Slide is a less powerful option than Stone Edge, but has superior accuracy and still provides solid coverage alongside Precipice Blades; Lave Plume gets a boost from sun as well as a new boost from STAB and can threaten the opponent's physically inclined Pokemon with burn status. Thunder Wave cripples opposing Pokemon with paralysis status, Roar gets rid of setup such as that of the aforementioned Xerneas, and Toxic is a decent option as well, seeing as how Steel- and Poison-types in general won't be comfortable sticking around to take Primal Groudon's attacks.</p>

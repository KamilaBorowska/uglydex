<p>With Tough Claws, increased bulk, and good Speed, Mega Metagross is a very threatening Pokemon in the Doubles metagame. Very few Pokemon can KO it, and even fewer Pokemon can switch in safely on its extremely powerful STAB attacks and coverage moves. With Clear Body stopping Intimidate before Mega evolving, it's hard to stop Mega Metagross from doing some major damage early in the game, and with a little speed control, it's hard to prevent it from sweeping later on as well.</p>

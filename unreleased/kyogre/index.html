<h1>Set</h1>

<div class=set>
    Kyogre @ Blue Orb<br>
    Ability: Primordial Sea<br>
    EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Origin Pulse<br>- Thunder<br>- Ice Beam<br>- Water Spout / Hidden Power Ground / Calm Mind
</div>

<p>This is an all-out attacking set for Primal Kyogre, highlighting its huge specially offensive prowess. 252 EVs in Special Attack with a Modest nature maximizes damage output and makes Primal Kyogre as powerful as possible. Origin Pulse is essentially a slightly more accurate Hydro Pump and is the main STAB move, hitting anything that doesn't resist it incredibly hard, factoring in the boost from rain. Thunder goes hand in hand with Primordial Sea, having perfect accuracy under rain and zapping the opposing Water-types that resist Origin Pulse. Ice Beam puts the hurt on Dragon-types and Grass-types that resist Water- and Electric-type attacks and is also a safe secondary move to hit Ground-types with in case they might switch out to a Water resist. Water Spout can be used earlier in the match while Primal Kyogre is in higher health, for a very strong and accurate rain-boosted STAB attack, but it becomes less reliable as Kyogre takes more and more damage. Hidden Power Ground is an option over Water Spout to 2HKO maximum HP Primal Groudon and deter it from switching in, although a specially defensive Primal Groudon set will be able to switch in safely. Finally, Calm Mind can work to improve Kyogre's special presence both offensively and defensively.</p>

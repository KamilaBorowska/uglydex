<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Tentacruel is a straightforward Pokemon to use in Ubers, with access to Rapid Spin and Toxic Spikes letting it both set up and remove entry hazards, giving it a niche that it shares with only Cloyster, Forretress, and Smeargle. What Tentacruel has over them, however, is a unique defensive typing and a sizable base 120 Special Defense stat, which allows it to pivot into defensive Fairy-types and proceed to set up or clear hazards. Protect and its ability, Rain Dish, allow it to check a powerful threat in Choice Scarf Kyogre with minimal prediction. Unfortunately, Tentacruel has a negligible offensive presence and is easily overwhelmed by physical attackers. It also lacks reliable recovery. Still, Tentacruel's unique support movepool is enough to justify its usage, especially in a tier where spinblockers are not very prominent.</p>

<h1>Support</h1>

</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin defines Tentacruel's niche in the tier as an entry hazard remover. Toxic Spikes cripples grounded foes with poison, pressuring switch-ins to Tentacruel's teammates and racking up passive damage over time. Scald gets STAB and is good for its burn chance, which discourages many Pokemon from switching too freely into Tentacruel. Protect lets Tentacruel rack up another turn of Black Sludge recovery and poison damage. This is especially effective in rain, as Rain Dish further replenishes Tentacruel's HP. Protect also lets Tentacruel scout what move Choice-locked foes use. Knock Off can be used over either Scald or Protect, as being able to remove items from foes is always useful. Note that Scald nets Tentacruel the 2HKO against Mega Blaziken, which may be required depending on team structure.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Possessing no reliable recovery move, Tentacruel appreciates passive recovery, making Black Sludge an ideal item choice. Black Sludge also cripples enemies that attempt to Trick Tentacruel's item away. 252 EVs are invested in both HP and Special Defense in order to maximize Tentacruel's special bulk, letting it stomach special attacks from the likes of Xerneas, Kyogre, and Palkia as well as possible. 30 Speed IVs can be used to give Tentacruel the edge in mirror matchups; being slower than an opposing Tentacruel allows Tentacruel to use Rapid Spin after it sets Toxic Spikes or set Toxic Spikes after it uses Rapid Spin.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>You should be proactive in maximizing the utility that Tentacruel's support moves provide. Do not let entry hazards accumulate, seek out opportunities to use Rapid Spin, and set Toxic Spikes via double switching into resisted hits or supportive Pokemon such as defensive Xerneas and specially defensive Palkia, which cannot do much to harm Tentacruel. Because of this, Tentacruel should be played more aggressively against stall teams, especially if carrying Knock Off, as those teams have a far harder time pressuring it and preventing it from switching in. Knock Off gives Tentacruel the edge against opposing Tentacruel, if you carry it. Try to keep Tentacruel relatively healthy, bearing in mind that it does not have reliable recovery. A healthy Tentacruel can check threats such as Choice Scarf Kyogre (if carrying Protect), non-stat boosting Xerneas, and even Blaziken (if carrying Scald). Don't let Tentacruel get burned, as it causes Tentacruel to lose instead of gain HP each turn, severely impairing its staying power.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Kyogre brings rain, which activates Tentacruel's Rain Dish. Choice Scarf Kyogre helps against Ground-types, which Tentacruel is weak to, notably being able to revenge kill Ground Arceus. Choice Scarf and Choice Specs Kyogre both appreciate Toxic Spikes support to pressure their checks, which are all grounded. A Ground-immune teammate that fares well against Ground-types in general is necessary, as Tentacruel is a magnet for powerful Ground-type attackers; such examples include Gliscor and Giratina-O. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Rayquaza and Ho-Oh are generally good teammates, as Tentacruel clears away Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin.</p>

<p>Make sure to pack teammates that can handle Mewtwo, such as Dark Arceus or Chople Berry Tyranitar. Physically defensive Yveltal is a good catch-all check to most of Tentacruel's checks and counters, beating Ground-types and Mewtwo with Foul Play and Sucker Punch, respectively. Ghost Arceus is another great teammate in this regard. Using Tentacruel removes the need for a support Arceus forme, letting you experiment with more offensively inclined Arceus movesets. Checks to Geomancy, Calm Mind, and Life Orb + Thunder Xerneas variants are required, as Tentacruel cannot deal with them. Specially defensive Clefable is a good teammate that can provide cleric support, checks Yveltal, can stall out poisoned Calm Mind Arceus formes, and can replenish Tentacruel's HP with Wish. Finally, note that status users such as Darkrai and Sableye are not good teammates, as their movesets do not synergize well with Toxic Spikes support.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Toxic poisons non-grounded foes, such as Lugia and Yveltal. Haze allows Tentacruel to mess with Calm Mind Arceus formes or poisoned sweepers hoping to set up in a pinch. Ice Beam nails Landorus-T and Rayquaza, which Tentacruel has no business staying in on otherwise.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p>It should be acknowledged that Tentacruel's poor offensive presence and lack of reliable recovery mean that most Pokemon beat it one-on-one. As such, its listed checks and counters are either Pokemon that can OHKO it outright, or hinder it from carrying out its support duties, essentially rendering it useless.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Gengar, Giratina, and Ghost Arceus prevent Tentacruel from using Rapid Spin, which can be extremely troublesome if backed up by sufficient entry hazard support.</p>

<p><strong>Grounded Poison-types</strong>: Grounded Poison-types such as Mega Gengar, Poison Arceus, and opposing Tentacruel remove Tentacruel's Toxic Spikes simply by switching in.</p>

<p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo's Psystrike OHKOes Tentacruel. Other Psychic-types such as Deoxys-A, Gothitelle, and the rare Psychic Arceus are also huge threats in this regard, although the first cannot switch into a Scald or Knock Off at all.</p>

<p><strong>Offensive Ground-types</strong>: Offensive Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Groudon, and Ground Arceus can all OHKO Tentacruel with Earthquake. They can also set up on Tentacruel, especially if holding a Lum Berry in the case of the former two.</p>

<p><strong>Calm Mind + Refresh Arceus formes</strong>: Calm Mind + Refresh Arceus formes can freely set up on Tentacruel without fear of status ailments.</p>

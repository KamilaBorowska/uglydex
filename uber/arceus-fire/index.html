<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Primal Groudon's introduction to the tier has effectively killed Fire Arceus's viability, due to Primal Groudon having a better typing and ability while also being one of Fire Arceus's most threatening checks. This leaves Fire Arceus without a viable niche, as anything it can do, Primal Groudon can do far better, with added perks. To be somewhat useful to a team, Fire Arceus has to run a fully offensive moveset without recovery, and even then it still loses to a number of huge metagame threats, no matter the coverage. Fire Arceus still has the bulk that all Arceus formes have, and this allows it to at least sponge some strong moves such as Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire and Xerneas's Moonblast. Mono-Fire typing gives Fire Arceus some form of offensive prowess, but also gives it a nasty weakness to some commonly seen types in the tier, as well as a Stealth Rock weakness.</p>

<h1>All-Out Attacker</h1>

    - Calm Mind<br>- Overheat<br>- Earth Power<br>- Thunder
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Fire Arceus has too many checks in ORAS Ubers, and as such, needs to run a fully offensive moveset without recovery to limit the possibilities of giving a top-tier threat a free turn. With Calm Mind boosts, Fire Arceus can potentially fire off boosted Overheats that are capable of OHKOing Extreme Killer Arceus and Xerneas at +1 after Stealth Rock damage. Earth Power is used to 2HKO offensive Primal Groudon, allowing Fire Arceus to potentially win if the switch is predicted. Thunder 2HKOes Primal Kyogre and Water Arceus, and can also 2HKO Ho-Oh after a Calm Mind boost. Ice Beam is an alternative move that can be used to hit Giratina-O, Latios, and Latias, which otherwise resist this entire moveset, while also OHKOing Mega Salamence and Rayquaza.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>200 HP EVs allow Fire Arceus to be somewhat bulky, and take Sacred Fires, Moonblasts, and other resisted moves easier. Maximum Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature put some serious damage behind Fire Arceus's attacks, while 56 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed neutral-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Rayquaza.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Fire Arceus's utility to a team is minimal, and as such, it should be switched in aggressively to allow it to actually get something done. Switch into Fairy-types such as Xerneas or Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and force them out, then use Calm Mind and hit whatever comes in with a boosted Overheat or coverage move. Using Overheat at any given chance also works, as with the Modest nature and maximum Special Attack, it will dent most switch-ins easily. Think carefully before using Overheat, however; a Fire Arceus with dropped Special Attack is easy setup bait for many threats, and Fire Arceus does not have the tools to stop them alone.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Unless Fire Arceus is running Ice Beam, Pursuit support is mandatory to prevent Latios and Latias from checking Fire Arceus every time it's brought in. Mega Aerodactyl, Tyranitar, and Mega Metagross are good users of Pursuit. Defog users such as Giratina-O, Latias, and Mega Scizor are appreciated, as Fire Arceus is very weak to entry hazards. Stealth Rock setters such as Dialga, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie are also good partners for Fire Arceus, as Ho-Oh can check it easily unless the entry hazard is up. Primal Kyogre checks such as Latios and Latias also work well as teammates. Groudon is a good teammate, as it brings sunlight to boost Overheat's power while also helping against Mega Salamence and enemy Primal Groudon. Dialga also does well against Mega Salamence and Giratina-O, making it a worthwhile partner for Fire Arceus. General checks to common threats such as Mega Salamence and Extreme Killer Arceus are necessary, as using Overheat will attract many threats that can easily set up.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>A defensive set with Special Defense investment, Roar, and Recover is a possible set that can check Geomancy Xerneas, but Primal Groudon can do this with much better results. Stone Edge can be used to KO Ho-Oh if your team needs it. A Swords Dance set with Shadow Claw, Earthquake, and Overheat can beat Giratina-O, Latios, and Latias that might expect the special set, but is easier to check in general. Fire Arceus's immunity to burns is also an advantage for a Swords Dance set. Spacial Rend hits Palkia and the previously mentioned Dragon-types that can usually check Fire Arceus, but Fire Arceus will lose to something else no matter the coverage anyway. Status moves such as Thunder Wave or Toxic can work for teams that need a surprise tactic; Fire Arceus can actually can be very unpredictable with its moveset, so many different moves can work to some degree of effectiveness.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: The bane of Fire Arceus's existence, Primal Groudon can switch into anything but Earth Power and threaten to OHKO, set up Stealth Rock, or boost in the face of Fire Arceus. Earth Power does 2HKO offensive sets, however.</p>

<p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Due to Primordial Sea giving a Fire immunity, Primal Kyogre can switch into Overheat for free and threaten to OHKO with Origin Pulse or set up Calm Mind boosts. Thunder does 2HKO non-specially defensive sets, however.</p>

<p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Latios and Latias's typing and Soul Dew-boosted Special Defense lets them switch into any move with ease and force Fire Arceus out. Ice Beam or Spacial Rend can hit them for good damage on the switch, but ultimately there isn't much Fire Arceus can do to them.</p>

<p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh's great special bulk and Fire resistance allows it to switch into Fire Arceus with ease if Stealth Rock is not up. A +1 Thunder can 2HKO Ho-Oh, however.</p>

<p><strong>Palkia</strong>: While uncommon in ORAS Ubers, Palkia can switch into any of Fire Arceus's moves barring the rare Spacial Rend and threaten to OHKO with Hydro Pump.</p>

<p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Due to their Fire resistance, Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Rock Arceus can switch in and easily KO Fire Arceus with their STAB moves.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-Resistant Pokemon</strong>: Generally, most things in Ubers that resist Fire, and can handle Fire Arceus's coverage, can check it.</p>

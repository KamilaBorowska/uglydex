<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Bug Arceus's typing offers no useful resistances, as any users of Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves have either secondary STAB or coverage moves that will destroy Bug Arceus. The Stealth Rock weakness further weakens Bug Arceus's longevity, removing 25% of its HP on every switch in. Bug isn't the worst offensive typing in Ubers, as there are many Psychic- and Dark-types in the tier. Unfortunately, Bug Arceus is easily checked by many things in Ubers, as anything that is somewhat bulky can withstand its attacks.</p>

<h1>Swords Dance</h1>

<div class=set>
    Arceus-Bug @ Insect Plate<br>

    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Swords Dance<br>- X-Scissor<br>- Earthquake<br>- Stone Edge
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Swords Dance is the preferred set over Calm Mind, as the existence of Ho-Oh leaves Calm Mind an unviable alternative. X-Scissor is the most powerful physical STAB move Bug Arceus can use and is effective against the numerous Psychic- and Dark-types in the tier, as it is able to OHKO Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, Darkrai, and the offensive Deoxys formes. Earthquake is used as coverage, allowing Bug Arceus to hit Primal Groudon, Mega Diancie, and most Steel-types. It should be noted that Earthquake is very weak without a boost from Swords Dance, and even then, Pokemon such as Primal Groudon can live a +2 Earthquake. Stone Edge is used to hit Flying-types such as Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Ho-Oh. Iron Head can be used over Earthquake if you wish to hit Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Fairy Arceus, which can otherwise check Bug Arceus easily.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximize Attack EVs to give Bug Arceus as much power as possible. Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Bug Arceus to outspeed anything under base 120 Speed and Speed tie with other Arceus formes and Mega Salamence.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Bug Arceus is best used as a late-game cleaner, once Primal Groudon and other checks are sufficiently weakened. Bug Arceus can also be used earlier in the match to revenge kill Calm Mind Latios or Latias if necessary. Bug Arceus's resistance to Ground- and Fighting-type moves can give it a way to switch in, but be very careful; most users of such moves typically have other coverage moves that can deal heavy damage to Bug Arceus. Bug Arceus can check Mega Lucario easily. However, Mega Lucario is rather rare.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Bug Arceus requires a huge amount of support to be even slightly effective. Defog users such as Latios, Latias, Mega Scizor, and Giratina-O can clear all entry hazards, all of which are very detrimental to Bug Arceus's longevity. Giratina-O also doubles as a check to Primal Groudon, a Pokemon that can counter Bug Arceus with ease, making it an effective partner. Other checks to Primal Groudon include Latios, Latias, Shuca Berry Dialga, and defensive Mega Salamence. Checks to Mega Salamence such as Dialga, Klefki, Tyranitar, and Mega Aerodactyl are appreciated, as Bug Arceus cannot beat it one-on-one without a Swords Dance boost. It should be noted that Bug Arceus has a hard time revenge killing Mewtwo and Nasty Plot Darkrai, so checks to them might be a good idea. Checks to Mewtwo include Latios, Latias, Yveltal, and Giratina-O, while checks to Darkrai include Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Tyranitar.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Bug Arceus's options are very limited. A Calm Mind set is a possibility, but Ho-Oh poses such a great threat to such a set that it is generally not worthwhile. Extreme Speed is a possible coverage move that allows Bug Arceus to get past faster threats and beat a boosted Darkrai if weakened. Non-STAB Extreme Speed is extremely weak, however, even with a Swords Dance boost.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon is able to switch into Bug Arceus easily and threaten to set up boosting moves, set up Stealth Rock, and OHKO Bug Arceus. Not even a +2 Earthquake can OHKO Primal Groudon, and therefore the matchup should be completely avoided until Primal Groudon is sufficiently worn down.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Salamence can switch into Bug Arceus and get a free turn to Mega Evolve thanks to Intimidate, then threaten to OHKO with its STAB move. If Salamence has already Mega Evolved when it switches in, Stone Edge can 2HKO non-bulky sets, but even with this, the best possible scenario is that Mega Salamence Speed ties with Bug Arceus and can potentially OHKO with Return or Double-Edge. The risk can be high for both sides, but mostly favors the Mega Salamence user.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost Arceus</strong>: Ghost Arceus resists Bug and takes pitiful damage from Bug Arceus's coverage moves, making it a good switch-in. Ghost Arceus can then threaten to countersweep with Calm Mind or Swords Dance, or it can burn Bug Arceus with Will-O-Wisp if using a defensive set.</p>

<p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O resists X-Scissor and is immune to Earthquake, leaving Stone Edge as Bug Arceus's only way to hurt it. Unfortunately, Giratina-O is bulky enough to avoid a 2HKO from even a +2 Stone Edge and can phaze with Dragon Tail.</p>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types that are neutral to Earthquake such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Mega Scizor are excellent checks to Bug Arceus.</p>

<p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Bug Arceus is actually very weak in comparison to other threats. Many Pokemon in Ubers can handle its attacks and check it as a result.</p>

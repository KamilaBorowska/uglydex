<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>A blistering base 180 Speed and access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock make Deoxys-S one of the best entry hazard setters in the Ubers metagame. Unlike its extremely frail counterpart Deoxys-A, Deoxys-S has the bulk to set up multiple layers of Spikes, whereas Deoxys-A is normally limited to a single layer. Deoxys-S's biggest advantage over Klefki is its access to Taunt, allowing it to prevent users of Defog from removing the entry hazards it has set up. Alternatively, Deoxys-S's bulk makes it a good user of dual screens as well. Unfortunately, Deoxys-S has a poor offensive presence, so it can do little if it is hit by Taunt. Moreover, Deoxys-S usually just sets up its screens or entry hazards and then faints, which means its efforts can go to waste if the opponent is able to get a Defog off. The arrival of two new Magic Bounce users in Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye also bother Deoxys-S by bouncing back its entry hazards. Luckily, Deoxys-S has access to Skill Swap in order to get past both of them. Stacking entry hazards is a bit more difficult in Ubers than it once was, but Deoxys-S has all the tools it need to do the job correctly.</p>

<h1>Entry Hazard Lead</h1>

<div class=set>
    Deoxys-Speed @ Focus Sash<br>
    Ability: Pressure<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly / Timid Nature<br>
    - Stealth Rock<br>- Taunt<br>- Spikes<br>- Knock Off / Skill Swap
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Stealth Rock discourages your opponent from switching their Pokemon often, and Deoxys-S's high Speed means it is all but guaranteed to set it up. Taunt lets Deoxys-S shut down opposing entry hazard leads, in addition to Defog users and setup sweepers. Setting up multiple layers of Spikes is also easy due to its high Speed. Spikes in combination with Stealth Rock will give your foes a difficult time switching in. Knock Off is an option to prevent Deoxys-S from becoming complete Taunt bait and to cripple foes that rely on their items. Alternatively, Skill Swap will steal Magic Bounce from the likes of Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, preventing them from reflecting your entry hazards back.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Focus Sash helps Deoxys-S set up an extra layer of entry hazards, as its bulk is subpar. The given EVs maximize Deoxys-S's Speed in order to ensure it can set up entry hazards quickly. If you are running Knock Off, then maximize its Attack investment and use a Jolly nature. Otherwise, use a Timid nature and a bulky EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This set will almost always be leading and is fairly predictable because of that. If you see a Pokemon that has a good type matchup against Deoxys-S in Team Preview, the opponent will likely use it as an anti-lead. Magic Bounce users are also likely to anti-lead, so make sure to use Skill Swap if you have it. Otherwise, lead with a teammate that can damage them. If the opponent has a Defog user, set up entry hazards before using Taunt on them.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Common sweepers such as Primal Groudon and Xerneas will threaten most Defog users with pure offensive pressure. Alternatively, Darkrai directly threatens common Defoggers such as Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O with its STAB Dark Pulse. A spinblocker, such as Ghost Arceus, will prevent foes with Rapid Spin from removing your entry hazards. A spinner provides entry hazard removal and, unlike Defog, Rapid Spin does not remove the entry hazards that Deoxys-S has already set up. A great spinner is Excadrill, which synergizes well on the offensive teams that commonly use Deoxys-S.</p>

<h1>Dual Screens</h1>

<div class=set>
    Deoxys-Speed @ Light Clay<br>
    Ability: Pressure<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Reflect<br>- Light Screen<br>- Taunt<br>- Stealth Rock
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Reflect and Light Screen will double the defenses of your team for 8 turns, giving Deoxys-S's teammates better opportunities to set up. Taunt prevents Defoggers from removing the dual screens, opposing leads from setting entry hazards, sweepers from setting up, and slower Taunt users from Taunting Deoxys-S. Stealth Rock further allows Deoxys-S to support its team and can be easily set up because of Deoxys-S's high Speed.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EVs and a Timid nature maximize Deoxys-S's bulk and Speed in order to ensure it can set up screens quickly and often. Light Clay is to prolong the duration of Reflect and Light Screen.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>With no attacking options, Deoxys-S is complete Taunt bait. If you see a Prankster Taunt user on your opponent's side in Team Preview, it may be used as an anti-lead for Deoxys-S, so hold off on sending it out. This set is often used as a lead, but is not limited to a leading role, as Deoxys-S's decent bulk gives it multiple opportunities to set up dual screens throughout the match. If the opponent brings in a potential Defogger, Taunt it and use the free turns that Taunt provides in order to bring in a setup sweeper.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Deoxys-S itself does not need a lot of support; instead, you need teammates that can take advantage of dual screens. It finds a home on hyper offense teams, as setup sweepers enjoy the added bulk from dual screens, which makes it easier for them to set up and sweep. Setup Pokemon that enjoy support from Deoxys-S include Nasty Plot Darkrai, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Dragon Dance Mega Salamence. Mega Gengar can switch in and trap a foe on a predicted Defog or a weakened attack.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Magic Coat is another way to punish opposing entry hazard leads as well as Prankster Taunt from Thundurus and Sableye, but Deoxys-S typically lacks room for the move, as it is better off using Skill Swap in this metagame. Deoxys-S has various offensive options, but often lacks room for them and is not powerful enough to make use of them most of the time. Mental Herb can be used to protect Deoxys-S from Prankster Taunt users, but it finds Focus Sash and Light Clay more useful.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Defog</strong>: Once Deoxys-S has fainted, a Defogger can easily wipe out your screens and entry hazards. The most threatening users are Latias, Latios, and Giratina-O, as Levitate grants them immunity to Spikes.</p>

<p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye can bounce back Deoxys-S's entry hazards.</p>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: Deoxys-S is vulnerable to priority attacks that can 2HKO it after it sets up only one layer of hazards, such as Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak and Arceus's Extreme Speed. A strong U-turn user such as Scizor can also cut down Deoxys-S's health and possibly bring it down to its Focus Sash while providing the user with a free switch into a priority attacker to pick off Deoxys-S.</p>

<p><strong>Prankster Taunt</strong>: Prankster Taunt cripples any Deoxys-S without Magic Coat. Also, even if it is carrying Magic Coat, the presence of Taunt often forces you to make a prediction.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-Hit Moves</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan, Cloyster, and Scolipede all carry multi-hit moves to break Deoxys-S's Focus Sash.</p>

<p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Sandstorm, poison, and burn are all ways to break Deoxys-S's Focus Sash.</p>

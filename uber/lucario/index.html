<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Lucario is a very powerful Mega Evolution because of a great ability in Adaptability and high offensive stats. It also functions as a decent stop to Xerneas, Dark Arceus, and Darkrai, because it can OHKO any of them with a STAB attack. Furthermore, it has a nice Speed stat, which allows it to outrun several threats in Ubers, such as Xerneas, Latias, Latios, Rayquaza, and Dialga. Lucario has a wide, offensively based movepool with a lot of coverage options, such as Ice Punch and Stone Edge. It also has a good priority option in Bullet Punch, which is boosted by Adaptability. However, Lucario is pretty frail, meaning most powerful attacks from Pokemon with decent offensive stats can deal a lot of damage to it. Additionally, either paralysis or burn will cripple Lucario. Lastly, Psychic- and Ghost-types can be troublesome for it if Lucario lacks a Dark-type attack, especially Mega-Sableye, which completely walls it.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Close Combat is extremely powerful after Mega Evolution, because it has a great 240 Base Power when boosted by Adaptability. Bullet Punch is a good priority attack with decent power and allows Lucario to 2HKO Geomancy Xerneas, as well as pick off some weakened Pokemon. Stone Edge hits most Flying-types, especially Ho-Oh, better than Ice Punch, especially Ho-Oh, better than Ice Punch. Ice Punch can be used as third move instead to hit other Flying-type Pokemon that trouble Lucario, such as Mega Salamence and Rayquaza, better than Stone Edge, and has excellent coverage on the overall. Iron Tail has more power than Bullet Punch and allows Lucario to OHKO Xerneas. Swords Dance allows Lucario to boosts its Attack stat to insane levels, which helps it to break through many physical walls.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Justified is chosen as Lucario's ability, allowing it to boost its Attack right after it switches into Dark-type attacks. Lucarionite lets Lucario Mega Evolve, and gives it a huge power boost and Adaptability, which doubles the power of Lucario's STAB attacks. Maximum EVs in Attack ensure Lucario hits its foes as hard as possible. The EVs in Speed backed up by a Jolly nature let Lucario outspeed several Pokemon in the tier such as max Speed Xerneas, max Speed Salamence, and max Speed Kyurem-W.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Lucario is a decent switch-in to Dark-type moves, especially when not Mega Evolved, since this will boost Lucario's Attack stat, thanks to Justified. However, be aware that most Dark-types are faster than Lucario when not Mega-Evolved and can beat it with another attack, as Lucario is a bit frail. Make sure you Mega Evolve Lucario as soon as possible, as it needs the power and Speed.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Cleric support from Pokemon such as Xerneas is very useful, as Lucario is really crippled by having either its Attack or Speed stat cut by burn or paralysis. Dark-types such as Yveltal and Darkrai are great teammates too, as they can beat up Lugia and Ghost-type Pokemon that are troublesome for Lucario. Yveltal is nice in particular because it can switch into the Ground-type attacks Lucario is weak to. Stealth Rock users, such as Primal Groudon or of the Deoxys formes, also make good partners because Stealth Rock helps Lucario get KOs earlier. Other Pokemon that appreciate Dark-types being defeated by Lucario, such as Aegislash and Latios, make for good partners as well. Slow Volt Switch or U-turn users, such as Scizor, grant Lucario a safe switch. Lastly, Defog users that remove Sticky Web when it's up on your side, such as Latias and Giratina-O, are good partners too.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Earthquake is an option for good coverage, but leaves Lucario completely walled by Flying-types if it lacks Stone Edge or Ice Punch. Crunch hits the Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Mega Gengar, Lugia, and Mega Mewtwo Y, that trouble Lucario. Extreme Speed can be used over Bullet Punch to outspeed any other +1 priority attack, but has bad coverage and after Mega Evolving Bullet Punch is equal in power. Nasty Plot can be used along with a special set of Aura Sphere / Flash Cannon / Dark Pulse or Vacuum Wave, but this doesn't allow Lucario to beat Geomancy Xerneas, which is one of the main Pokemon it should be beating, and because of that the Nasty Plot set is not very good.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types, such as Ghost Arceus, Giratina, Mega Gengar, and Mega Sableye, are immune to Lucario's most powerful STAB option, and can burn Lucario and stall it out.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Flying-types</strong>: Bulky-Flying types, such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Yveltal, resist Lucario's Close Combat (except for the last) and can stall it out and steadily recover health back, but they must be wary of Stone Edge.</p>

<p><strong>Ground-types</strong> Ground-types such as Primal Groudon, Ground Arceus, and Landorus-T can easily beat Lucario with one of their STAB attacks, and can reliably switch into most of Lucario's attacks, but have to be wary of Ice Punch.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns and paralysis reall Lucario, as it will have its Attack or Speed cut, which means it misses out on important KOs.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Mewtwo X</strong>: Mega Mewtwo X can switch into one of Lucario's attacks, outspeed it, and beat it with a Fighting-type STAB attack. It cannot continiously switch in, however.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are faster than Lucario, such as Choice Scarf Kyogre, Mega Mewtwo, or Jolly Mega Salamence, can beat Lucario with one of their coverage attacks without effort.</p>

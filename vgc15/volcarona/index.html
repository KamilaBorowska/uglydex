<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Volcarona boasts a great base 135 Special Attack stat and access to a great spread STAB move in Heat Wave. With the right investment and nature, it can Speed tie with Mega Kangaskhan and other threatening base 100 Speed Pokemon. Volcarona also has access to Flame Body, which can burn physical attackers, and Swarm, which can boost its already powerful Bug Buzz. It also has access to both Rage Powder and Quiver Dance. However, Volcarona has a massive 4x weakness to Rock, which is one of the most common attacking types in VGC, as well as painful weaknesses to Water and Flying. One last negative factor about Volcarona is that it can't really do much outside of its STAB attacks and support moves.</p>

<h1>Quiver Dance</h1>

<div class=set>
    Volcarona @ Charti Berry / Lum Berry<br>
    Ability: Flame Body / Swarm<br>
    EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Heat Wave<br>- Bug Buzz<br>- Quiver Dance<br>- Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Heat Wave is a STAB spread move, hitting very hard coming off base 135 Special Attack. Bug Buzz prevents Volcarona from being walled by Garchomp, Cresselia, Hydreigon, and other Pokemon that resist Fire. Quiver Dance boosts Volcarona's Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed, allowing it to outspeed certain threats such as Garchomp, Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and positive-natured base 100s such as Mega Kangaskhan. Protect lets Volcarona's partner either soften up a threat for Volcarona to finish off the next turn or eliminate the threat entirely.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Due to Volcarona's base 100 Speed, it needs maximum Speed investment to be able to tie with other base 100s such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard. The EV spread is not complicated because Volcarona thrives off as much Speed and attacking power as it can get. Charti Berry lets Volcarona take a Rock Slide from Landorus-T or 4 Atk Timid Tyranitar without a Life Orb. Lum Berry prevents paralysis or sleep. Flame Body can be useful in the highly physical metagame by burning contact attackers such as Kangaskhan. Swarm's niche makes the damage output of Bug Buzz go through the roof when Volcarona is at low health. Modest nature maximizes Heat Wave and Bug Buzz damage, as Volcarona can boost its Speed with Quiver Dance.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>When using Volcarona, you need to be very aware of whether or not the foe carries Rock Slide. If you need to use Protect to scout, then do so. If you think your opponent has a Rock Slide user in the back, setting up with Quiver Dance is usually not an option unless you think Volcarona and its partner can eliminate the threat before the threat eliminates it. Volcarona can be very effective against teams with a lot of special attackers, as Quiver Dance boosts its Special Defense. The same can be said for teams with redirection, as Heat Wave hits both targets anyway.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Hitmontop should be considered, as it's the only Pokemon with all of Wide Guard, Fake Out, and Intimidate. Other Intimidate user such as Landorus-T or Salamence increase Volcarona's chances of taking physical attacks. Pokemon that resist Flying and Rock, such as Bisharp, Metagross, Tyranitar, and Rotom-W, also make for good partners; Rotom-W is an especially good partner because it makes great use of Will-O-Wisp to hinder physical attackers. Speed control users such as Thundurus and Cresselia take stress off of the player to set up Quiver Dance. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan provide more windows to set up Quiver Dances, and Volcarona appreciates having a physically attacking partner. Helping Hand can support Volcarona's strong Heat Waves.</p>

<h1>Rage Powder</h1>

<div class=set>
    Volcarona @ Rocky Helmet / Sitrus Berry<br>
    Ability: Flame Body<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 204 Def / 52 SpA<br>
    Bold Nature<br>
    - Overheat<br>- Bug Buzz<br>- Rage Powder<br>- Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Overheat does more direct damage than Heat Wave, which, with this spread, will do minimal damage. Bug Buzz hits Hydreigon, Cresselia, and other Pokemon that resist Overheat. Rage Powder redirects all non-spread, non-Grass-type moves to Volcarona. Protect allows Volcarona's partner to eliminate threats so that Volcarona can stick around longer.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EVs allow Volcarona to survive a multitude of attacks, including Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, Adamant Landorus-T's Rock Slide, +2 Modest Aegislash's Shadow Ball, Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch, and Bisharp's Sucker Punch; it also has over an 80% chance of surviving Life Orb Garchomp's Rock Slide. This set can also assure that Overheat OHKOs standard Mega Mawile, has a 50% chance of OHKOing standard Amoonguss, and can 2HKO standard Aegislash. Flame Body is the only option on this set because the increased power of Bug Buzz isn't worth giving up the chance to burn physical attackers. Rocky Helmet to damages contact physical attackers. Sitrus Berry can be used instead for greater longevity.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Because of how this Volcarona is meant to play out, knowing what it can and can't survive is a crucial aspect of supporting its partner. Before you make use of Rage Powder, stop and think about what you gain and lose by taking two hits that turn. Although it's not the best tactic, you can bluff an offensive set by using Bug Buzz and luring your opponent into targeting Volcarona's partner and then pulling the trigger with Rage Powder.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>This set can support a lot of frail Pokemon such as Breloom, Greninja, Weavile, or Mega Gallade. Rage Powder and Volcarona's passable bulk synergize decently with Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence, which like Volcarona's sponging of Fighting- and Ice-type moves aimed at them, respectively.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran, but other than that it doesn't have many uses. Giga Drain hits bulkier Water-types such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, Suicune, and Swampert. Just note that Giga Drain doesn't have much extra power over Bug Buzz and will leave Volcarona wide open for Hydreigon to come in and steadily eliminate it. Hurricane is a choice if Volcarona has Politoed support, but there are usually better options such as Tornadus-T for power or Amoonguss for redirection.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Rock Slide</strong>: Volcarona is maimed by even the weakest of Rock Slides if it lacks a Charti Berry. Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tyranitar all make for effective Rock Slide users versus Volcarona</p>

<p><strong>Other Super Effective Attacks</strong>: For how many resistances Volcarona's unique typing grants it, it has a whole host of exploitable weaknesses. Talonflame and Mega Salamence's Flying-type attacks and most every Water-type will make short work of it.</p>

<p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence will easily take out the more offensive sets, and even the most defensive Volcarona can't survive Adamant Mega Salamence's Double-Edge.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran, Charizard, and Rotom-H can wall Volcarona to oblivion, and usually Volcarona either does little damage to them or is taken out before it can set up enough to deal sizable damage.</p>

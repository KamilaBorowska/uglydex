<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Base 100 HP and base 105 Special Defense stats make Jellicent capable of surviving a plethora of special attacks, including Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam, Mega Gengar's Shadow Ball, Mega Manectric's and Rotom-W's Thunderbolt, Hydreigon's Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse, and Sylveon's Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voice. Its usable base 85 Special Attack stat, rather low base 60 Speed stat, access to Trick Room, and amazing coverage moves such as Water Spout, Scald, Shadow Ball, and Ice Beam turn Jellicent into a formidable Trick Room setter and attacker.</p>

<p>While Jellicent's Water / Ghost typing may seem bad at first glance, it is nothing to laugh at; although it gives Jellicent four weaknesses, it also grants six resistances as well as immunities to Normal- and Fighting-type attacks such as Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and Terrakion's Close Combat. In addition, Water Absorb makes Jellicent immune to Water-type attacks, resulting in the possession of three immunities. Unfortunately, Jellicent's mediocre base 70 Defense stat makes it incapable of taking common physical attacks such as Mega Salamence's Double-Edge, Bisharp's Knock Off, and Talonflame's Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird.</p>

<h1>Bulky Support</h1>

<div class=set>
    Jellicent @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Cursed Body<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 156 Def / 100 SpD<br>
    Calm Nature<br>
    - Scald<br>- Will-O-Wisp<br>- Recover<br>- Hex / Shadow Ball / Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Scald is Jellicent's main attack, doing solid damage with a chance to burn its target. Will-O-Wisp lets Jellicent cripple physical attackers. Recover keeps Jellicent operating longer. Protect allows Jellicent to scout as well as dodge double targets. Protect is normally mandatory in doubles, but Jellicent is bulky enough that Hex or Shadow Ball can be considered. Ice Beam can be used in the final slot if you want to deal with Landorus-T and Dragon-types faster.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EV spread allows Jellicent to survive Hydreigon's Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse, Mega Salamence's Double-Edge, and two Earthquakes from Landorus-T. Cursed Body is used over Water Absorb, as the possibility of crippling your opponent's Pokemon is far more useful for this set than a Water immunity. Jellicent makes a solid Leftovers user thanks to its bulk.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Use Jellicent's useful array of resistances to come in and start spreading burns. Use Recover when Jellicent's taken a beating. If the opponent is likely to switch Pokemon, it's best to go for a Will-O-Wisp or Recover as they switch, as a Pokemon that is resistant to Jellicent's attacks is likely coming out.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Jellicent enjoys the company of Pokemon that can buy it some time to burn the foe. In this sense, Mega Kangaskhan and Amoonguss make for good partners. Grass- and Fire-types, such as Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, synergize well with Jellicent. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Fairy-types such as Sylveon help deal with Jellicent's vulnerability to Dark-types such as Hydreigon.</p>

<h1>Trick Room</h1>

<div class=set>
    Jellicent @ Sitrus Berry / Mental Herb<br>
    Ability: Water Absorb / Cursed Body<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 244 SpA / 12 SpD<br>
    Quiet Nature<br>
    - Trick Room<br>- Water Spout / Scald<br>- Shadow Ball / Ice Beam<br>- Recover / Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Trick Room supports Jellicent and its teammates by helping them move first if they're slow. Water Spout is Jellicent's most powerful STAB attack and hits both foes but is unreliable in terms of power; the lower Jellicent's remaining HP is, the lower Water Spout's power is. Scald is significantly less powerful under certain conditions but has a nifty 30% chance to inflict a burn on its target. Shadow Ball is Jellicent's Ghost-type STAB attack, hitting Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Ice Beam scores an OHKO against Mega Sceptile, Mega Salamence, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. In general, it is useful for hitting Dragon-types. Recover restores 50% of Jellicent's maximum HP, keeping Jellicent healthy and maintaining Water Spout's high power. Protect can be used in place of Recover, as it protects Jellicent for a turn.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximizing Jellicent's HP stat increases its natural bulk. 12 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Modest Mega Gengar's Shadow Ball will never OHKO Jellicent. The remaining EVs are distributed into Jellicent's Special Attack stat to let it hit as hard as possible. A Quiet nature further boosts Jellicent's Special Attack stat; it also lowers Jellicent's Speed stat, allowing Jellicent to be faster under the effects of Trick Room. 0 Speed IVs make Jellicent as slow as it can possibly be. A bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 60 Def / 92 SpA / 100 SpD with a Sassy nature could be utilized, as it lets Jellicent survive a Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse from Modest Hydreigon and ensures that Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake is a 3HKO; if using this EV spread, Jellicent should be given Leftovers. Sitrus Berry helps maintain Water Spout's power and increases Jellicent's longevity. Mental Herb, on the other hand, helps prevent Taunt, which guarantees that Jellicent will successfully set up Trick Room.</p>

<p>Water Absorb is the preferred ability because it heals Jellicent by 25% of its maximum HP every time it is hit by a Water-type move, further maintaining Water Spout's power if Jellicent is sent into a predicted Water-type attack. Cursed Body, on the other hand, is useful in combination with Recover, helping Jellicent stall out attacks such as Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball, and can also mess with Pokemon holding a Choice item. Because most Jellicent use Water Absorb, opponents probably won't have their Pokemon attack Jellicent with a Water-type move anyway; if you can, try to bluff a Water Absorb set. If you decide to use Cursed Body, it should strictly be used alongside Recover.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Use Trick Room as a partner uses Fake Out or Protect. Water Spout is the move that Jellicent should be using most of the time, so if Jellicent is at low HP, use Recover to maintain its high Base Power. If running Water Absorb, have Jellicent switch in on predicted Water-type attacks to heal some of its HP. If Cursed Body is being used, spam Recover to stall out the foe's move; their attack will be disabled eventually.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Slow Fake Out users such as Hariyama and Scrafty help Jellicent safely set up Trick Room. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and the aforementioned Fake Out users pair well with Jellicent, as Jellicent can beat the Psychic-types that threaten all but Scrafty, and they can beat the Dark-types that threaten Jellicent. Mega Mawile can also handle Dark-types, and Jellicent can beat the Fire-types that threaten Mega Mawile. Politoed's Drizzle ability sets up rain, and if Jellicent has Water Absorb, Politoed can spam Surf to constantly heal Jellicent to keep it healthy and retain Water Spout's power. Redirection support from Pokemon such as Togekiss and Amoonguss helps Jellicent safely set up Trick Room. Togekiss can handle most of the Dark-types that threaten Jellicent, and Jellicent can handle the Fire-, Psychic-, and Ice-types that threaten Amoonguss, which works especially well under Trick Room. Mega Camerupt and Mega Abomasnow are both great Trick Room sweepers that can easily dispose of the Grass-types that threaten Jellicent. Mawile and Scrafty provide Intimidate support, giving Jellicent an easier time against physical attackers. In VGC, you can get away with using two Trick Room setters; as a result, Cresselia and Gothitelle are good partners for Jellicent. They provide Helping Hand support to boost the power of Jellicent's attacks to monstrous levels; however, these Pokemon share Jellicent's weakness to Ghost-type moves.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Jellicent's very diverse movepool includes moves such as Hydro Pump, Surf, Icy Wind, Blizzard, Giga Drain, Energy Ball, Sludge Bomb, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp. Safety Goggles prevents Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss from putting Jellicent to sleep with Sleep Powder and Spore, respectively, and makes Jellicent immune to Rage Powder as well as residual damage from sand and hail. Rocky Helmet racks up quick damage against Pokemon with contact moves. A set bluffing Trick Room can also be utilized.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Type Advantages</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss resist Water Spout, can put Jellicent to sleep with their respective sleep-inducing move, and do a fair amount of damage with Giga Drain. Dragon-types such as Mega Sceptile, Mega Salamence, and Hydreigon also resist Water Spout, and threaten Jellicent with a Leaf Storm, Double-Edge, and Dark Pulse, respectively. They do, however, have to be wary of Ice Beam. Other Pokemon that resist Water Spout include Ludicolo and Rotom-W; Ludicolo threatens Jellicent with Giga Drain, and Rotom-W threatens Jellicent with Thunderbolt. Cursed Body Jellicent may attempt to stall out these moves with Recover, but can't do much damage in return. Life Orb Thundurus has a very low&mdash;but possible&mdash;chance to OHKO Jellicent with Thunderbolt, and Bisharp easily OHKOes Jellicent with Knock Off. Ghost-types, such as Gengar, its Mega Evolution, and Aegislash, trade attacks with Jellicent. Most of the time, Jellicent wins, but depending on the scenario, Jellicent could fall short to one of those Pokemon.</p>

<p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Sun from Mega Charizard Y weakens Jellicent's main STAB attack, Water Spout, and also powers up Solar Beam, which is a big threat to Jellicent. Tyranitar sets up sand to boost its Special Defense and has a chance to OHKO Jellicent with Crunch.</p>

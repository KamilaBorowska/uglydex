<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Milotic has a nice tool in the form of Competitive, which allows Milotic to check Intimidate users. 95 / 79 / 125 bulk, pure Water typing, and access to Recover make Milotic surprisingly hard to take down. While Milotic doesn't have a wide movepool, it's more than adequate for Milotic to fulfill its purpose on its team.</p>

<h1>Anti-Intimidate Tank</h1>

<div class=set>
    Milotic @ Leftovers / Sitrus Berry / Assault Vest<br>
    Ability: Competitive<br>
    EVs: 236 HP / 140 Def / 132 SpA<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Scald<br>- Ice Beam / Icy Wind<br>- Recover / Icy Wind<br>- Protect / Mirror Coat
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Scald is a is STAB move and has a good chance to burn foes. Ice Beam offers great coverage, hitting threats such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Salamence, as well as Grass-types super effectively. Icy Wind, however, still hits targets with a 4x weakness to Ice hard, is a spread move, and offers Milotic the ability to provide speed control. Recover greatly increases Milotic's longevity, but it is unusable with Assault Vest. For the last slot, Protect is great option for Milotic to scout dangerous super effective attacks. On other hand, Mirror Coat allows Milotic to annoy powerful threats such as Rotom-W and Thundurus.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>236 HP and 140 Defense EVs allow Milotic to survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, while 132 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature allow Milotic to hit as hard as possible. Leftovers increases Milotic's longevity and works great with Recover. Sitrus Berry gives Milotic one-time healing, but in the long run it doesn't heal as much as Leftovers. With Assault Vest, Milotic can't use status moves, but it becomes very specially bulky. If you use Assault Vest, Icy Wind and Mirror Coat should be used over Recover and Protect. You can also invest more into Speed if you want to outspeed Rotom-W, or even base 100 Speed Pokemon after Icy Wind.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Milotic should be paired with physical attackers. Opponents will have two choices: either deal with a +2 Milotic or a physical attacker at normal power. Milotic can do lot of damage on the field if it manages to get a Competitive boost, and thanks to its great bulk, it is hard for opponents to take down. Typically, Milotic should tank hits while using Scald and occasionally Ice Beam or Icy Wind. Milotic can either lead for a potential Competitive boost if the opponent leads with an Intimidate user, or it can be saved for late-game to finish off weakened targets. You can also switch Milotic into a predicted Icy Wind to get a Competitive boost.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that hate Intimidate are good partners to Milotic; examples include almost every physical attacker, including Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Talonflame. Intimidate users are also good partners, because they help patch up Milotic's physical bulk. Arcanine deserves a special mention, as it has overall good type synergy with Milotic and has access to Will-O-Wisp, Intimidate, and Snarl to make itself and Milotic really annoying to take down. Bulky Grass-types are great partners to Milotic; for example, Amoonguss can absorb Electric-type attacks aimed at Milotic. Milotic also has good synergy with Mega Venusaur, which enjoys Milotic's ability to provide Icy Wind support and beat Mega Salamence. Mega Venusaur also beats bulky Water-types, which Milotic hates.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Hydro Pump can be used to give Milotic a chance to OHKO Mega Mawile and Mega Manectric after a Competitive boost, and it hits decently hard even without Competitive boost. It, however, has a chance to miss, cannot burn foes, and has lower PP. Hidden Power Fire can be used if Ferrothorn bothers your team too much, while Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit opposing Water-types, but it's pretty weak. Safeguard and Light Screen can be used as well, but this role is better left for true support Pokemon such as Cresselia. As weird as it sounds, Choice Scarf can be used on Milotic. Choice Scarf Milotic with a Timid nature can outspeed Landorus-T, Terrakion, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence and OHKO them all with either Hydro Pump or Ice Beam. A Wacan Berry can be used to weaken the damage of one Electric-type move aimed at Milotic. With a Wacan Berry, 252 HP EVs, and 76 Special Defense EVs, Milotic can survive two of Rotom-W's Thunderbolts.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Ludicolo, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur give Milotic a really hard time because Milotic can't hit them reliably. Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur can just Leech Seed Milotic avoiding Mirror Coat and slowly KO it.</p>

<p><em>*Electric-types</em>: Thundurus and Rotom can fire off powerful Thunderbolts at Milotic. Rotom-W is especially annoying, as Milotic can't do anything against it if Milotic lacks Hidden Power Grass or Mirror Coat.</p>

<p><strong>Preventing a Competitive Boost</strong>: Without a Competitive boost, Milotic can be dead weight if it can't hit super effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Sun</strong>: Milotic hates sun, as its Water-type moves are pretty weak in sun. Mega Charizard Y can hit really hard with Solar Beam and is often paired with Grass-types.</p>

<p><strong>Powerful Physical Attacks</strong>: Even with a high amount of HP and Defense investment, Milotic doesn't enjoy taking powerful physical attacks such as Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, Mega Mawile's Play Rough, and Talonflame's Brave Bird.</p>

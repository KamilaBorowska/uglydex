<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Thanks to Aegislash's bulk in its Shield Forme, it can often switch into resisted or even neutral attacks. With two formes, Aegislash essentially has 720 BST, but is forced to run King's Shield so that it can alter to its Shield Forme after attacking. Aegislash can offer Wide Guard support and has lots of defensive synergy with Mega Evolutions such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence while also having the ability to beat Mega Evolutions such as Mega Kangaskhan 1v1. However, Aegislash does have a weakness to common attacks such as Earthquake and Knock Off.</p>

<h1>Two Attacks</h1>

<div class=set>
    Aegislash @ Leftovers / Weakness Policy<br>

    EVs: 252 HP / 100 SpA / 156 SpD<br>
    Quiet Nature<br>
    - King's Shield<br>- Substitute / Wide Guard<br>- Shadow Ball<br>- Flash Cannon / Sacred Sword
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon are Aegislash's main STAB moves, though Sacred Sword can be used over Flash Cannon to hit Hydreigon and Bisharp more effectively. Substitute protects Aegislash from status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, while Wide Guard provides support to it and its teammates by protecting them from spread attacks such as Hyper Voice, Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Heat Wave. King's Shield is necessary, as it lets Aegislash alter back to its Shield Forme after it attacks.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>If Aegislash is running Substitute, then it will need Leftovers so that it can slowly recover the HP lost; however, if this is not the case, then choosing to run a Weakness Policy will apply more offensive pressure. At +2, Aegislash will force the opponent to concentrate on it rather than its teammate. 156 Special Defense EVs allow Aegislash to survive a Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse from Modest Hydreigon, and after the boost from Weakness Policy, Aegislash has a high chance of OHKOing Hydreigon with Flash Cannon. A Quiet nature and minimum Speed investment help Aegislash be the slowest Pokemon on the field so that it can tank hits in its Shield Forme, although you may tinker with the IVs so that it can outspeed certain threats.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>When not threatened, Aegislash should always use Substitute so that the opponent will be pressured to remove its Substitute. Try to stay in Shield Forme as long as possible so that Aegislash can utilize its base 150 defenses, but using a Substitute can give Aegislash some free turns to attack. Wide Guard is an excellent move to use when playing against Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Landorus-T, which have multi-target moves. Please note that Aegislash can successfully spam Wide Guard, but using King's Shield right after could result in failing.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon synergize well with Aegislash as it resists Rock-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type attacks, while the Dragon-types resist Fire, and Flying-types are immune to Ground. Terrakion is a great partner because it beats Dark- and Fire-types, while Wide Guard can allow it to avoid being hit by Hyper Voice and Earthquake. Pokemon that are weak to spread moves appreciate Wide Guard support, and are therefore great teammates. Fake Out users can give Aegislash an opportunity to set up a Substitute. Fairy-types are good partners for Aegislash because they can take on the Dark-types that threaten it, and Aegislash resists Steel while also being immune to Poison.</p>

<h1>Three Attacks</h1>

<div class=set>
    Aegislash @ Weakness Policy / Life Orb / Spooky Plate<br>

    EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpA<br>
    Quiet Nature<br>
    - King's Shield<br>- Shadow Ball<br>- Flash Cannon<br>- Shadow Sneak / Sacred Sword
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Shadow Ball is Aegislash's main STAB move, and Flash Cannon hits Fairy-types hard. Shadow Sneak helps pick off foes if Aegislash has a +2 boost or if they are really weakened, while Sacred Sword hits most Dark-types for super effective damage. King's Shield is necessary, as it lets Aegislash alter back to its Shield Forme after it attacks.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>For a more offensive Aegislash, a simple EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpA should be used, but again, 156 Special Defense EVs let Aegislash survive a Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse from Modest Hydreigon. A Weakness Policy is chosen as the main item because it gives a +2 boost to Aegislash's offensive stats if it is hit by a super effective attack. However, a Life Orb can be used for an instant 30% boost in power to its attacks without having to risk being KOed by a super effective attack. A Spooky Plate gives a 20% boost in power to Aegislash's Ghost-type attacks, and is another nice option because it will be using Shadow Ball most of the time, but it is generally inferior to Weakness Policy or Life Orb because it doesn't power up anything else other than the former and Shadow Sneak. 0 IVs in Speed help Aegislash be the slowest Pokemon on the field so that it can tank hits and retaliate with a strong attack, but again, tinkering with the IVs may allow it to outspeed certain threats.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>With Sacred Sword, Aegislash fears Dark-types less, but should still stay in Shield Forme to tank hits. Use Flash Cannon to threaten Fairy-types. If you opt to use a Weakness Policy, try to bait super effective attacks onto Aegislash so that it can get a +2 boost to both of its offensive stats, allowing it to KO foes more reliably. Without Wide Guard, be more aware of attacks such as Earthquake and Heat Wave, and it is important to stay in Shield Forme often, as this specific Aegislash doesn't have Substitute.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon synergize well with Aegislash, as it resists Rock-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type attacks, while the Dragon-types resist Fire, and Flying-types are immune to Ground. Terrakion is a great partner because it beats Dark- and Fire-type Pokemon that threaten Aegislash. Pokemon that can't quite pick up KOs are helped by Aegislash because Shadow Sneak finishes off the foe. Redirection support helps prevent Sucker Punch from hitting Aegislash. Fairy-types make for good partners for Aegislash because they can take on the Dark-types that threaten it, and Aegislash resists Steel and is immune to Poison.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Lum Berry handles Swagger and other status conditions like sleep, so Aegislash can counter Dark Void. Offensively, Aegislash doesn't have too many options, but you can opt for Hidden Power Ice or even Sleep Talk if your team is really weak to sleep. Rock Slide can be used, as it is super effective against Fire-type Pokemon, knocking them out at +2 after baiting the switch.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon threaten Aegislash with their super effective STAB attacks. Most notable are Bisharp and Hydreigon, which are very troublesome for Aegislash, as both are able to OHKO it. Due to Defiant, Bisharp doesn't mind attacking into King's Shield.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt from Thundurus or Sableye forces Aegislash to stay in Blade Forme, which means that it can't tank hits, and Sucker Punch can be spammed on Aegislash as well.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion</strong>: Confusion is very dangerous, as when trying to attack, Aegislash has 150 base Attack and only base 50 Defense, so hitting itself hurts.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Lopunny</strong>: Mega Lopunny can OHKO Aegislash when in Shield Forme with its STAB High Jump Kick, although it risks hitting into a King's Shield.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Charizard Y</strong>: Mega Charizard Y threatens Aegislash with a sun-boosted Overheat or Heat Wave.</p>

<p><strong>Earthquake Users</strong>: Without Wide Guard, Aegislash fears Earthquake, so common users such as Excadrill and Landorus-T are feared.</p>

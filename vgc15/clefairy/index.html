<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Clefairy is a Follow Me user that unsurprisingly functions similarly to Clefable which has a better offensive presence and a wider array of item options. However, Clefairy possesses Friend Guard and an item that probably won't lead to conflict with the Item Clause. While Clefairy might be humongous Taunt bait, Friend Guard's defensive boost gives Clefairy a huge edge over other Follow Me users.</p>

<h1>Follow Me</h1>

<div class=set>
    Clefairy @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Friend Guard<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 172 Def / 20 SpA / 60 SpD / 4 Spe<br>
    Bold Nature<br>
    - Follow Me<br>- Helping Hand<br>- Moonblast / Icy Wind<br>- Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Follow Me lets Clefairy redirect and tank hits for its partner. Helping Hand lets Clefairy boost its partner's offenses and makes up somewhat for its bad offenses. Moonblast is Clefairy's strongest and most reliable attack, while Icy Wind is a much weaker attack that provides speed control. Protect shields Clefairy for a turn.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Friend Guard is the main reason to use Clefairy over Clefable or Togekiss. The ability reduces the damage Clefairy's partner Pokemon receives, making Clefairy's partner very hard to deal with. 252 HP / 172 Def lets Clefairy always survive Adamant maximum Attack Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge. The Special Attack investment allows Clefairy's Moonblast to OHKO 4 SpD Hydreigon 100% of the time. If using Icy Wind, move the Special Attack EVs to Special Defense.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Follow Me is used to protect Clefairy's partner from attacks, and Helping Hand is used occasionally to boost the partner's offenses. Don't be afraid to let Clefairy go down if it's taking a lot of nasty hits. It's better for Clefairy to do its job for a little while than sit around and not do anything later on.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that can set up with Substitute or boosting moves, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Metagross, Mega Salamence, Swords Dance Terrakion, Nasty Plot Thundurus, and Heatran are all great partners. Tailwind and Trick Room users such as Suicune and Jellicent greatly appreciate Follow Me's redirectional support and Friend Guard's Defensive boost. Pokemon that can take out Steel-types, such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, are also good partners. Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Steel-types such as Aegislash and Heatran naturally compliment Clefairy. A rule of thumb when using Clefairy is to make sure that its partner is able to make up for Clefairy's extreme lack of offensive presence.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Thunder Wave provides Clefairy with an alternate method of speed control. Moonlight can be used to keep Clefairy healthy longer. Heal Pulse and Aromatherapy allow Clefairy to further support its partner, though both moves are fairly situational. Tickle and Fake Tears can be used to help soften up the opponent's team, but Clefairy is very slow and usually can't use either of these moves before its partner gets the chance to move. Clefairy is one of the most viable users of Gravity, if that interests you.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt reduces Clefairy's usefulness severely. Taunt users to be wary of include Thundurus and Gengar.</p>

<p><strong>Strong Steel- and Poison-type Attacks</strong>: Mega Mawile can OHKO Clefairy regardless of defensive investment. Aegislash can 2HKO Clefairy with Flash Cannon. Bisharp's Iron Head will always 2HKO Clefairy, and Life Orb sets even have a chance to OHKO.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Noibat has really awful stats, both offensively and defensively and a natural weakness to Stealth Rock, so it's a stretch to consider it a good Pokemon. However, it has a decent 16 Speed with a Timid nature, and its movepool is quite interesting. Its resistances (Bug, Fire, Grass, Water, and above all Fighting) and immunities (Ground) even help it as well.
Considering its unusual STAB combination, Special Attack stat, and the interesting combination of Frisk, Switcheroo, and Choice Specs, it could have an amazing, albeit niche, role.</p>

<h1>Choice Specs</h1>

<div class=set>
    Noibat @ Choice Specs<br>
    Ability: Frisk / Infiltrator<br>
    EVs: 36 HP / 236 SpA / 236 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Draco Meteor<br>- Hurricane<br>- U-turn<br>- Switcheroo
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Draco Meteor and Hurricane are powerful and uncommon STAB moves, so it's quite hard to deal with them. Switcheroo switches Noibat's item with the foe's, while U-turn is a good way to gain momentum when it's inconvenient to engage a certain enemy.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Thanks to Frisk, Noibat can scout what items opposing Pokemon are carrying so you can see if it's better to switch items or not. It's also important, for example, to identify if a foe is holding a Choice Scarf. Finally, it can cripple many physical attackers such as by switching a Choice Specs onto Pawniard, as well as Chinchou and other Flying-type counters. Otherwise, use Inflitrator to obtain a pure sweeper. The EV spread maximizes Noibat's Special Attack and Speed, and uses a Timid nature to sustain offensive power and reach 16 Speed. There's no Attack investment because U-turn is used almost entirely for scouting purposes, not damage. Draco Meteor and Hurricane hit very hard with Choice Specs, even if Noibat's base Special Attack is poor.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Noibat works as a good wallbreaker, using powerful Choice Specs-boosted STAB moves. At the same time, Frisk and Switcheroo can neutralize enemies. You have two different ways to play Noibat: you can either take the foe down or determine if it's appropriate to switch items or U-turn away, so Noibat is versatile.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Noibat needs a good Defogger or Spinner as a teammate because it suffers from a Stealth Rock weakness. Noibat also appreciates Stealth Rock support to attain more KOs and to wear down opposing Pokemon in general. A rain setter could be appreciated, too, if you want to use Noibat as a good rain sweeper, as Hurricane becomes 100% accurate. Steel-types are good defensive teammates, given Noibat's weaknesses to Fairy and Ice. Noibat has a good synergy with Magnemite and Pawniard in particular, because Noibat resists or is immune to all their weaknesses. At the same time, sweepers such as Carvanha and Scraggy appreciate a potential item switch, which could cripple walls such as Spritzee and physical attackers such as Zigzagoon with Choice Specs.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Noibat has few other options. Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball are available, if you want a pure sweeper set with Inflitrator, but it's not so good because there aren't many Substitute users that Noibat can overpower. Even though Hurricane's miss chance outside rain is risky, Air Slash simply doesn't hit hard enough. Hidden Power Fire's coverage isn't great, even if it KOes Ferroseed. Solar Beam could be a choice on a sun team. However, it doesn't actually provide a lot of useful coverage with Noibat's STAB moves. Finally, Noibat is too frail to utilize Roost effectively.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: These include Fletchling, Snover, Shellder, Timid Staryu, Abra, Drilbur, Onix, and Gasly. Although they may struggle to switch into Noibat's attacks, they will easily take advantage of its abysmal defenses and heavily damage it once they do get in; for example, Fletchling OHKOes Noibat with priority Acrobatics, and Abra is faster and lethal with Dazzling Gleam.</p>

<p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Archen outspeeds Noibat and quickly beats it with Rock Slide, while Aron can revenge kill Noibat with Head Smash.</p>

<p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Spritzee and Munchlax don't take that much damage from Noibat's attacks and can retaliate very hard.</p>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Even if they can't switch in safely, Magmemite and Pawniard can easily KO Noibat. Bronzor resists its attacks, too.</p>

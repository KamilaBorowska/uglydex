<h1>Tiers</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href='/uglydex/lc/frillish'>LC</a>
</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<ul>
<li>Unique typing and abilities. </li>
<li>Only bulky Ghost-type with Recover. </li>
<li>Decent SpA. </li>
<li>Knock Off is rampant and makes Frillish's job quite limited. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Frillish @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Cursed Body / Water Absorb<br>
    EVs: 236 HP / 116 Def / 76 SpA / 76 SpD<br>
    Bold Nature<br>
    - Scald / Surf <br>- Shadow Ball<br>- Recover<br>- Will-O-Wisp / Toxic 
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<ul>
<li>Scald is Frillish's main STAB attack and is useful for checking Pokemon such as Mienfoo while also nailing Fire-types who may be switching into a predicted Will-O-Wisp. </li>
<li>Shadow Ball is a good coverage move, hitting Gastly and Slowpoke super effectively. </li>
<li>Recover is an obvious move as it gives Frillish longevity. </li>
<li>Will-O-Wisp is a very useful status for Frillish as it still allows it to beat Pokemon such as Mienfoo who cannot break Frillish even with Knock Off. </li>
<li>Toxic and Surf can be used as well, though it does not have the Attack-reducing effect. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<ul>
<li>EVs maximize bulk with even numbers for Eviolite. The rest are invested in SpA. </li>
<li>Cursed Body and Water Absorb come down to personal preference. Water Absorb works best if there is no other Water-type resist on the team, but otherwise Cursed Body is generally more useful. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Frillish is best used as a check for certain Fighting-, Fire-, and Normal-types.</li>
<li>It is usually best to use Frillish as a check, since it has trouble switching in on predicted attacks, but has no trouble forcing Pokemon out. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>Frillish can barely dent Pokemon such as Chinchou on the switch, so any Pokemon immune to Volt Switch would make a good teammate for Frillish. </li>
<li>While Frillish can absorb most Fighting-type attacks, it cannot effectively take Knock Off. With this in mind, Pokemon such as Trubbish or itemless Fletchling work well with Frillish. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Choice Scarf</h1>

<div class=set>
    Frillish @ Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Cursed Body / Water Absorb<br>
    EVs: 76 HP / 236 SpA / 196 Spe <br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Water Spout<br>- Shadow Ball<br>- Energy Ball / Surf <br>- Trick 
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<ul>
<li>Water Spout is Frillish's highest damage attack. </li>
<li>Shadow Ball is a good coverage move, hitting Slowpoke super effectively. </li>
<li>Energy Ball hits Chinchou and Tirtouga hard.</li>
<li>Since Shadow Ball hits those Pokemon neutrally, Surf can be used as a backup Water-type move.</li>
<li>Trick lets Frillish severely dampen the usefulness of special walls. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<ul>
<li>EVs maximize Speed to reach 14, while the rest are put in SpA to maximized damage. There are 76 EVs leftover that can be put into HP. </li>
<li>Water Absorb and Cursed Body both have their merits and come down to personal preference. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>This Frillish set is best used as an early-game revenge killer before Stealth Rock is down to weaken Water Spout. </li>
<li>If hazards are removed late game, it can sweep a weakened team with Water Spout. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>Frillish can barely dent Pokemon such as Chinchou on the switch, even with Energy Ball, so any Pokemon  immune to Volt Switch would make a good teammate for Frillish. </li>
<li>While Frillish can absorb most Fighting-type attacks, it cannot effectively  take Knock Off. With this in mind, Pokemon such as Trubbish or itemless Fletchling work well with Frillish. </li>
<li>Anything that removes hazards reliably works well with Frillish, since it needs its full HP to deal maximum damage with Water Spout. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<ul>
<li>Choice Specs can be used, but it lacks the Speed to be used effectively. </li>
<li>Trick Room can be set up effectively by Frillish. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Chinchou</strong>:  Chinchou is bulky enough to not care too much about Shadow Ball or Energy Ball and can use any Electric-type attack to deal major damage to Frillish.</p>

<p><strong>Timburr</strong>: Timburr cannot be neutralized buy Will-O-Wisp and can deal damage back with Knock Off. </p>

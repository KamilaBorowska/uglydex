<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Sewaddle does not see much usage due to the existence of Spinarak and Surskit. Its six weaknesses and middling Speed make it hard for Sewaddle to come in and set up. However, Sewaddle does have some advantages over its competition, namely in defensive prowess, as well as a new immunity to powder-based moves.</p>

<h1>Sticky Web Setter</h1>

<div class=set>
    Sewaddle @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Chlorophyll<br>
    EVs: 156 HP / 196 Def / 40 SpA / 116 SpD<br>
    Bold Nature<br>
    - Sticky Web<br>- Energy Ball<br>- Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Rock<br>- Air Slash
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Sticky Web gives your team the advantage by lowering the Speed of the opponent's grounded Pokemon by one stage. This makes it easier for slower, powerful Pokemon to sweep. Energy Ball is Sewaddle's obligatory STAB attack. Hidden Power Fire is used to hit enemy Steel-types such as Ferroseed and it is further powered up if the sun is present. Hidden Power Rock is an alternative to hit Flying- and Fire-types on the switch-in, nailing Larvesta especially hard. Air Slash is to hit opposing Fighting-type Pokemon, and it also hits opposing Grass-types for decent damage.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given combination of EVs allows Sewaddle to switch into Stealth Rock multiple times while maintaining its bulk, and a Bold nature is used to take physical hits better. If you are using Hidden Power Rock, Sewaddle needs to have 200 Defense and 120 Special Defense EVs to make up for the IV drops. This means there are not enough EVs available to invest in Special Attack. Chlorophyll is the primary ability, as Overcoat is quite redundant with Sewaddle's new immunity to powder moves and lack of synergy on sand teams. Swarm is also a mediocre ability, as Sewaddle prefers to stay at high healh, and this set doesn't have a Bug-type attack for Swarm to boost anyways.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Set up Sticky Web when you can; Sewaddle has completed its primary job if this is done. To accomplish this, it is usually best to lead with Sewaddle or switch into a  Water-, Fighting-, Ground-, or Electric-type move. Sewaddle is also the only Sticky Web user that doesn't have to rely on Focus Sash since it has the defenses to take a few non-super effective hits, and Eviolite helps it considerably in that regard.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Vulpix is Sewaddle's best partner. Despite sun aggravating Sewaddle's Fire weakness, it doubles its Speed. Pokemon resistant to Fire- and Flying-type moves are also great partners. Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite and Water-types including Slowpoke and Mantyke can switch into these moves, while Sewaddle can take Electric- and Ground-type attacks aimed at them. Rock-types such as Archen and Tyrunt also resist Fire- and Flying-type moves, so they make excellent defensive partners, too. Also, bear in mind that slower Pokemon can utilize Sticky Web to sweep. Pokemon like Pawniard, Mienfoo, and Timburr make good offensive teammates that appreciate the Speed advantage. Charmander and Helioptile are offensive sun partners that also benefit from Sticky Web support.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>A Life Orb Chlorophyll set consisting of SolarBeam / Hidden Power Fire / Bug Buzz / Air Slash is a possibility, but is gimmicky. Calm Mind is an option for boosting power and special bulk. Sewaddle can use Sunny Day to trigger Chlorophyll without Vulpix support. It's notable that Sewaddle has access to Agility, Iron Defense, Calm Mind, and Baton Pass as well as it can use these moves to pass boosts to a teammate. Bug Buzz is a secondary STAB option, but it doesn't hit very many Pokemon for super effective damage, apart from Purrloin and Psychic-types. Lastly, Sewaddle gets Magic Coat to deflect status moves, but its incompatibility with Sticky Web makes it a poor option in most scenarios.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Pokemon with super effective moves</strong>: Sewaddle has six weaknesses, all of which are relatively common attacking types. Even with Sewaddle's decent defenses, it cannot withstand even the weakest of Fire- and Flying-type moves.</p>

<p><strong>Stealth Rock and status</strong>: Sewaddle dislikes Stealth Rock, as it strips a quarter of its health away each time it enters battle. It is also not fond of status.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt / Defog</strong>: Defog and Taunt make Sewaddle semi-useless or render it setup bait. Sewaddle usually cannot do much against users of these moves</p>

<p><strong>Specially bulky Pokemon</strong>: Any Pokemon with great special bulk can wall Sewaddle. Munchlax and Porygon are able to tank everything Sewaddle has. Spritzee can come in on Sewaddle, heal off any damage taken, and set up multiple Calm Mind boosts.</p>

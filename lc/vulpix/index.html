<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>As the monarch of sun offense courtesy of its metagame-defining ability Drought, Vulpix wields a significant degree of influence for its capability to hold entire teams on its shoulders, dilute the offensive prowess of many Water-types, and account for the viability of all Chlorophyll users. Its impressive supportive and offensive movepool means it's far from a sitting duck, as with the correct move, it has the potential to seriously cripple or 2HKO just about every threat in LC. Moreover, these characteristics allow it function as an effective stand-alone Pokemon, easily checking many dangerous threats such as Snover, Croagunk, and Magnemite. Vulpix's Drought ability makes its Fire-type STAB moves some of the strongest attacks in the game. With its impressive offensive presence blended together with its good 17 Speed, Vulpix is able to equip a Choice Scarf and function as a fantastic late-game sweeper and revenge killer all the same.</p>

<p>While the level of support Vulpix provides is unquestionably good, it's limited to no more than eight turns of sun at most with a Heat Rock. This limitation of support requires Vulpix to be played with precision and long-term planning, especially when taking into account that dedicated sun teams absolutely require its support to do anything noteworthy. To add insult to injury, Vulpix isn't so difficult to wear down due to its susceptibility to Stealth Rock as well as having rather mediocre defenses, which makes switching into even neutral-STAB attacks a daunting task. Overall, Vulpix is the personification of a "team player", as even after its demise, it might just leave a few turns of sun to pave the way for your team's victory.</p>

<h1>Offensive Sun Support</h1>

<div class=set>
    Vulpix @ Heat Rock<br>
    Ability: Drought<br>
    EVs: 52 HP / 196 SpA / 236 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Fire Blast<br>- Energy Ball<br>- Will-O-Wisp / Hypnosis / Toxic<br>- Protect / Hidden Power Ground / Roar
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Fire Blast is Vulpix's most powerful STAB of choice, being quite powerful, especially in the sun. However, its middling accuracy may draw some players towards Flamethrower. Energy Ball gets great coverage alongside Vulpix's Fire-type STAB, as it hits bulky Water-types, such as Chinchou and Tirtouga, for super effective damage. Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers and helps give Vulpix take some attacks better. Toxic, however, can cripple special walls such as Munchlax or other Fire-types who are immune to Burn, such as Ponyta. Hypnosis is useful for providing free turns and helps Vulpix pivot to Chlorophyll sweepers. Similarly, protect keeps Vulpix safe from Fake Out and helps secure switches. Hidden Power Ground is another coverage move to hit other Fire-types. Finally, Roar can be useful for a team that is worried about Torchic and other set-up sweepers.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Heat Rock is beneficial for extending the duration of sun from 5 to 8 turns which helps Chlorophyll sweepers by giving them more time on the battlefield. A Timid nature is used to outspeed some physical attackers like Adamant Mienfoo that can be crippled with Will-O-Wisp. If using Hidden Power Rock, use the EV spread 52 hp / 200 SpA / 236 Spe. </p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>The set's main job is to keep the sun out while using Vulpix's powerful coverage options to help its teammates with sweeping. Vulpix doesn't always need to be the lead; it all depends on the opponent's team. For example, it may help to first remove certain pokemon, such as Sticky Web setters, which can make Vulpix's job a lot harder.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Vulpix is usually the supporter of the team, but it does appreciate some help from its teammates. Rock- and Ground-types such as Archen and Drilbur, respectively, can help Vulpix by being able to check certain Rock-, Ground-, and Flying-types, which usually give sun teams some trouble. Other Fire-types appreciate sun for being able to remove their Water-type weakness while simultaneously boosting their Fire-type STAB moves. Chlorophyll sweepers such as Oddish or Bellsprout are capable of using Vulpix's sun to the fullest potential by getting a Speed boost and sweeping through teams.</p>

<h1>Choice Scarf</h1>

<div class=set>
    Vulpix @ Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Drought<br>
    EVs: 52 HP / 196 SpA / 240 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Fire Blast<br>- Energy Ball<br>- Hidden Power Rock<br>- Overheat / Sleep Talk
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Fire Blast is insanely powerful, especially when amplified by sun. Energy Ball hits bulky Water-types such as Chinchou, while Hidden Power Rock can deal a solid amount of damage to other Fire-types such as Larvesta or Ponyta. Finally, Overheat is an extremely powerful and accurate attack, however, due to its secondary effect, it should only be used in quick situations where raw power is needed over longevity. Sleep Talk allows Vulpix to switch in on common sleep inducers such as Foongus, Cottonee, and Bellsprout and still be able to threaten them. If you do decide to run Sleep Talk, it is recommended that you forgo a fourth move to increase your chances of using a more potent coverage move, namely Fire Blast or Energy Ball.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The Choice Scarf allows Vulpix to fill the role as a nasty revenge killer or late-game sweeper. Vulpix's high Base Power moves are even further amplified in the sun, which Vulpix will always be under. However, this set is less useful in terms of team support due to the lack of Heat Rock, which will sun to only 5 turns.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This set is both an effective revenge killer and potent team supporter, as it uses Vulpix's Speed and power to force threats out while still summoning sun for other sweepers. It's best used mid-game to open holes in the opposing team's defense, which gives other sweepers an easier time. Additionally, Energy Ball provides great coverage against lured-in Rock- and Water-types. Keep in mind, however, that without the Heat Rock, Vulpix can only summon sun for up to 5 turns. This is not bad for Vulpix, but makes sweeping with Chlorophyll sweepers a bit more difficult.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>As with most Fire-types, Vulpix greatly appreciates a teammate that can maintain control over entry hazards. Drilbur makes for a good partner, as it is able to handle opposing Rock- and Fire-types, set up Stealth Rock, and keep the field clear with Rapid Spin. Oddish and Bellsprout are the two best Chlorophyll abusers, so naturally they pair well with Vulpix, which also benefits from their ability to weed out bulky Water- and Rock-types. Diglett is able to trap other Fire-types such as Ponyta that wall most of Vulpix's sets.</p>

<h1>Life Orb</h1>

<div class=set>
    Vulpix @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Drought<br>
    EVs: 40 Def / 196 SpA / 240 Spe<br>

    - Overheat<br>- Fire Blast<br>- Energy Ball<br>- Hidden Power Rock / Will-O-Wisp
</div>

<p>nature: Timid</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>A sun-boosted Overheat will roast almost everything in the metagame. However, due to its secondary effect, it isn't a good option to use if you need Vulpix to say in longer, in which case Fire Blast is the better option. Energy Ball and Hidden Power Rock are used for their good coverage, however, Will-O-Wisp can be used instead of one to cripple physical switch-ins such as Archen or Munchlax.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Life Orb in tandem with the sun makes Vulpix's Fire-type moves insanely powerful. With only 4 IVs in HP, Vulpix hits 19 HP, which minimizes Life Orb and entry hazard damage. This set is a very potent lure to bulky Pokemon such as Chinchou and Archen, which Vulpix can remove with its good coverage and insane power to allow other Pokemon to sweep. If using Will-O-Wisp instead of Hidden Power Rock, use the EV spread of 36 Def / 196 SpA / 240 Spe. </p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>The set's main job is to hit incredibly hard. It also reaches a solid 17 Speed, so it can revenge kill slower threats, however, it is still outpaced by faster Pokemon such as Abra and Ponyta. Due to its Stealth Rock weakness and general fraily, Vulpix should not being switching in on many Pokemon. However, it finds its best opportunities by preying on slower Pokemon such as Foongus and Ferroseed.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Vulpix's wallbreaking abilities combined with Drought give Chlorophyll sweepers an easier chance to sweep, though keep the 5 turn sun limit in mind. Entry hazard controllers such as Drilbur and Archen make Vulpix's life easier, as they are able to remove hazards and set up Stealth Rock, which is incredibly important in netting the 2HKO on many would-be Vulpix counters such as Archen. Knock Off is another great utility to help maximize Vulpix's power. Mienfoo and Pawniard are both good abusers of the move and are able to clear out any bulky Rock-types which threaten Vulpix.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Pain Split may be used so that Vulpix isn't worn down as easily and works effectively on many of its common switch-ins such as Munchlax; however, its mechanics make it a rather inconsistent recovery option. On the flip side, when used correctly, the move can be quite good at wearing down Vulpix's checks. RestTalk is another form of recovery and is a little more consistent. By utilizing RestTalk, Vulpix also works as an effective status sponge and can also run a more defensive spread so that it can last longer throughout the match. Due to the fact that Vulpix forces quite a few switches, Substitute can be used to take advantage of those opportunities, and may also be used with Disable for even more disruptive shenanigans. In regards to other methods of healing, Berry Juice is a very effective way to keep Vulpix healthy, but it comes at the cost of sacrificing Heat Rock, which reduces the effectiveness of Vulpix's supportive role. Flamethrower is a more accurate move as it has a perfect accuracy so it can be used over Fire Blast, however Fire Blast has more power and will usually be more effective. Extrasensory is nice to hit Water-types that aren't hurt much by Energy Ball like Skrelp and Tentacool. Flame Charge can also be a good option on more offensive variants, as the +1 Speed boost can prove especially useful to prevent Choice Scarf users from constantly forcing Vulpix out. Lastly, Sunny Day is a good option to regain momentum the instant that Hippopatas attempts to switch in and override Drought with Sand Stream.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Bulky special walls</strong>: Bulky special walls such as Munchlax, Spritzee, Lickitung, specially defensive Hippopotas, and Goomy can take all of Vulpix's attacks quite easily.</p>

<p><strong>Reverse weather sweepers</strong>: Reverse weather sweepers such as Rain Dance Mantyke can threaten Vulpix if the sun is not out.</p>

<p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off users can strip away Vulpix's Heat Rock and Choice Scarf, essentially taking away much of its utility.</p>

<p><strong>Fire- and Rock-types</strong>: Archen, Ponyta, Growlithe, and Tyrunt can check Vulpix, but have to watch out for certain status moves and Hidden Power.</p>

<p><strong>Houndour and Diglett</strong> Houndour and Diglett both work as decent offensive checks; Diglett in particular can trap Vulpix and stall out sun turns with Substitute.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong> Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes limit the number of times Vulpix can come in and summon sun.</p>

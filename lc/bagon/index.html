<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Bagon is blessed with a great ability in Sheer Force, boosting the power of moves with a secondary effect. It also has access to Dragon Dance and Hone Claws, two great setup moves that complement Sheer Force, and great coverage moves to take advantage of it as well. Bagon maxes out at 18 Attack, equaling prominent threats such as Timburr and Jolly Pawniard. There are several negative qualities about Bagon, however. It has mediocre Speed and defenses, and requires turns to set up to be useful. Lastly, it is forced out by Fairies with no way of dealing any reasonable damage to them, which is detrimental to its use.</p>

<h1>Dragon Dance</h1>

<div class=set>
    Bagon @ Life Orb / Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Sheer Force<br>
    EVs: 196 Spe / 236 Atk / 76 Def<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Dragon Dance<br>- Dragon Claw<br>- Rock Slide / Zen Headbutt<br>- Fire Fang / Crunch
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Dragon Dance is the move of choice to set up and sweep, allowing Bagon to outspeed many threats and gain an Attack boost. Dragon Claw is the preferred STAB move for this set, but it is not boosted by Sheer Force and causes Bagon to take recoil damage from Life Orb. Rock Slide is a great coverage move that deals with Flying- and Fire-types such as Vullaby, Fletchling, Archen, Ponyta, Larvesta, and Houndour. Zen Headbutt hits Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr and Poison-types such as Koffing, Grimer, and Trubbish super effectively. Fire Fang allows Bagon to hit Bug-, Steel-, and Grass-types including Cottonee, which otherwise beats it, while Crunch is for handling Ghost-types.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Attack investment is preferred to hit as hard as possible, and 196 Speed EVs allow Bagon to outspeed the whole unboosted tier. An Adamant nature allows it to hit extra hard while still being able to reach 21 Speed at +1. Life Orb allows Bagon to hit hard without taking damage thanks to Sheer Force, while Eviolite gives it some bulk and improves its longevity. Keep in mind that Eviolite gives Bagon less offensive prowess and may leave it underwhelming damage-wise.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Bagon appreciates entry hazards, to get past pesky Sturdy + Berry Juice users or other Pokemon with Sturdy that can stop a sweep in its tracks. A slow pivot such as Magnemite works well with Bagon, as Volt Switch allows it to get into battle unscathed. Setting up on a support Pokemon is recommended, as a Dragon Dance boost or two is crucial for Bagon to outspeed threats and improve its sweeping capabilities. Fairy-types should also be eliminated before setting up, as they stop Bagon dead in its tracks.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>As far as team options go, Bagon needs lots of support. Bagon appreciates entry hazards to KO threats that would otherwise survive an attack, especially Sturdy users. Ferroseed makes a great teammate, as it takes hits for Bagon very well and can also set up entry hazards. Staryu is a good specially based spinner which ensures that Bagon's HP isn't whittled down by entry hazards. Bagon still struggles against Spritzee, so it appreciates a teammate like Pawniard or Croagunk to take care of it. Pawniard also can also deter the use of Defog and gets rid of threats like Fletchling for Bagon.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>There are a few other options for Bagon. It can run a specially based set with Hydro Pump, Dragon Breath / Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, and a Hidden Power. A support set consisting of Wish / Protect / Dragon Claw / Toxic is also viable. Rock Head can be used in tandem with Double-Edge on an alternative Dragon Dance set. Brick Break can be used to deal with Steel-types such as Aron and Pawniard. Finally, Hone Claws can be used as Sheer Force helps with the inaccurate moves, but Bagon does not have enough Speed or bulk to pull this off effectively. Dragon Rush works especially well in tandem with Sheer Force, Life Orb, and Hone Claws.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Spritzee always forces a switch, unless it is at low health. Cottonee can come in and Encore either Dragon Dance or Dragon Claw to force a switch. They can also hit Bagon with Dazzling Gleam for super effective damage.</p>

<p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Choice Scarf Snover and Smoochum can easily come in and KO Bagon, provided it hasn't set up a Dragon Dance yet. Bear in mind that they only check Bagon, as a Rock Slide or Fire Fang will KO with a boost.</p>

<p><strong>Steel- and Rock-types</strong>: Shieldon and Aron take little damage even from boosted attacks, so they force a switch and can set up Stealth Rock in the process.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: All forms of status hinder Bagon. Poison whittles it down and can cut short a sweep, paralysis renders its Speed boosts useless, and a burn halves its Attack.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Poochyena is, overall, a mediocre Pokemon. Although XY gave Poochyena coverage against Fighting-types with Play Rough, and nerfed Steel-types so that Poochyena's Dark-type STAB moves have better coverage, Poochyena still remains on the list of Pokemon that are either used very situationally or just not good in general. This is because Poochyena's best stat is its lackluster base 55 Attack. Poochyena is also very frail, and faints to almost any STAB attack. It is also very susceptible to priority, namely Mach Punch. Poochyena also relies on Quick Feet to outspeed most Pokemon, forcing it to hold a Toxic Orb. You should always consider other options before you use Poochyena, because there are many.</p>

<h1>doge (Quick Feet)</h1>

<div class=set>
    Poochyena @ Toxic Orb<br>
    Ability: Quick Feet<br>
    EVs: 236 Atk / 36 SpD / 236 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Crunch<br>- Play Rough<br>- Facade<br>- Fire Fang / Howl
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Crunch is Poochyena's main STAB move, dealing the most damage to opposing Pokemon that resist any of Poochyena's other moves. Play Rough is used to provide coverage against Fighting-types and other Dark-types. Facade reaches 140 Base Power with Toxic Orb's poison, hitting neutral threats rather hard. Fire Fang is an option to hit Pawniard and most other Steel-types harder than Crunch, while Howl can boost Poochyena's Attack. Sucker Punch is an option to hit Choice Scarf users, but it is unreliable, and Poochyena already outspeeds most Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>236 Attack EVs max out Attack with a neutral nature, while 236 Speed EVs in combination with a Jolly nature allow Poochyena to hit 21 Speed with Quick Feet. 36 Special Defense EVs are filler and add a point to Special Defense. A Toxic Orb is held to poison Poochyena, which activates Quick Feet, boosting Poochyena's Speed.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Poochyena almost never finds a free turn for Quick Feet to activate or to use Howl, so it's best sent out against a Pokemon that it can check, allowing it to set up, and then finish it off. Poochyena is rather straightforward, however, so attacking is its only main concern.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Dwebble make for great partners, as Poochyena isn't very strong to begin with, so hazard support allows it to score more OHKOs and 2HKOs. Snubull and Spritzee are good partners, as they can help cover up Poochyena's Fighting-type weakness. Scraggy and most other physical wallbreakers can weaken or get rid of physical walls such as Dwebble, Aron, and Ferroseed, which can all take a hit from Poochyena.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Poochyena can use Thief over Crunch to steal items such as Berry Juice, but the power drop is very noticeable. A Life Orb set with Crunch, Sucker Punch, Fire Fang, and Ice Fang has a greater damage output than with Quick Feet. However, Poochyena is too slow to use it, and it will most likely be KOed before it does any major damage. Iron Tail can be used to hit Fairy-type Pokemon, but it is extremely inaccurate. Poison Fang can also be used to hit Fairy-types, but it is very weak. Super Fang can easily slice an opponent's health in half, making it a good option. Yawn can force switches, but Poochyena usually can't find a turn to use it. A RestTalk Heal Bell set can work, but Poochyena is too frail to run it to its best capability.</p>

<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Timburr, Machop, and Croagunk all force Poochyena out either by outspeeding with a Choice Scarf, or by OHKOing with priority Fighting-type attacks. They must be wary of Play Rough, however.</p>

<p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Unless Poochyena is running a move such as Iron Tail to hit them, Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubull can walk all over Poochyena.</p>

<p><strong>Hard Hitters</strong>: Life Orb or Choice Band/Specs users can easily KO Poochyena, due to its very low defenses.</p>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority moves such as Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave can easily 2HKO Poochyena before it can do major damage.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Bulky attackers such as Porygon can take a hit from Poochyena and retaliate with ease.</p>

<p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users and revenge killers in general can easily outspeed and heavily damage, if not OHKO, Poochyena. </p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Despite its below average stats and a common typing, Shellder has managed to carve itself a notable niche in the metagame. Thanks to Skill Link, several of its moves have essentially 125 Base Power as they always hit five times. Also, its access to the coveted Shell Smash gives Shellder the ability to significantly boost its Attack and Speed, allowing it to threaten a good portion of the metagame. However, several glaring weaknesses inhibit Shellder. It relies too much on boosts, meaning that it either has to use a turn to set up or run a Choice Scarf and lock itself into a move, both of which can be a detriment to Shellder's sweep. Also, Shell Smash lowers Shellder's defenses, leaving it even more vulnerable to priority attacks. Its typing and horrible Special Defense stat also leave it vulnerable to most Electric-type Pokemon, like Magnemite and Chinchou.</p>

<h1>Shell Smash Sweeper</h1>

<div class=set>
    Shellder @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Skill Link<br>
    EVs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 36 Def / 196 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Shell Smash<br>- Rock Blast<br>- Razor Shell / Icicle Spear<br>- Ice Shard
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Shell Smash can be used to boost Shellder's offensive capabilities and bypass its would-be counters. Rock Blast benefits from Skill Link and deals with Flying- and Fire-type threats, such as Archen and Wild Charge Ponyta, while also landing a neutral hit on Water-type Pokemon so they don't wall it completely. Razor Shell has STAB and fantastic coverage. Icicle Spear takes advantage of Skill Link, but using it instead of Razor Shell makes Steel-types more difficult to handle. It does, however, give Shellder the ability to get through Grass-type Pokemon better. Ice Shard is necessary to hit Fletchling before it can hit Shellder with a priority Acrobatics and to hit Cottonee before it can inflict any damage or status. Also, with proper prediction, it causes Sucker Punch to fail.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature let Shellder hit as hard as possible. 196 Speed EVs are enough for Shellder to reach 26 Speed after Shell Smash, outspeeding the entire unboosted tier and most common Choice Scarf users. Skill Link is a must, as it causes Rock Blast and Icicle Spear to hit five times every time they're used, significantly increasing Shellder's damage output. Running a Jolly nature is an option, but it's generally better to run Adamant, as Shellder will have little trouble outspeeding most things in the metagame after a Shell Smash. Eviolite grants increased Defense and Special Defense before Shell Smash and effectively nullifies the drops afterwards.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Once Shellder's counters are weakened or removed, set up Shell Smash on a weaker opponent or a predicted switch. From there, it's only a matter of choosing the right move to dominate your enemy. Shellder can bypass Focus Sash users and some Sturdy users with its multiple-hit moves, making it an asset to teams that have trouble with Pokemon like Dwebble or Focus Sash Abra. Due to its outstanding physical defense, Shellder finds it easy to set up on many physical attackers such as Mienfoo, Drilbur, and Archen.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>If Shellder runs Icicle Spear instead of Razor Shell, Steel-types can be a problem. Magnemite and Diglett are good teamates for trapping and KOing these Pokemon. Knock Off support can aid Shellder in weakening bulky Fighting-types and other physical walls such as Spritzee. Hazard support is greatly appreciated to break Sturdy on the likes of Magnemite.</p>

<h1>Revenge Killer</h1>

<div class=set>
    Shellder @ Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Skill Link<br>
    EVs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 36 Def / 196 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Icicle Spear<br>- Rock Blast<br>- Razor Shell<br>- Ice Shard
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Icicle Spear and Rock Blast are both powerful moves that benefit from Skill Link and provide coverage against most of the metagame. Icicle Spear lets Shellder deal with Grass-type Pokemon that threaten it, while Rock Blast helps it beat Fire-types and land neutral hits against Water-types. Razor Shell is an important STAB move that can help Shellder get through Steel-types, which otherwise wall it. Ice Shard lets Shellder deal with Fletchling before it can seriously damage or KO Shellder. It also lets Shellder damage Cottonee before it becomes a serious threat.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are required to hit 14 Speed and outspeed the rest of the metagame after the Choice Scarf boost. Some of the remaining EVs go into maximizing Attack, and the rest go into HP and Defense in order to increase bulk. Choice Scarf is a given, as it boosts Shellder's Speed and bolsters its sweeping potential.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This Shellder should be used as a revenge killer, interrupting opposing momentum and shutting down opposing threats. Thanks to Icicle Spear and Rock Blast, Shellder can bypass Sturdy and Focus Sash and check offensive Pokemon through a Substitute, making it even more potent. It can also operate as a fairly strong late-game cleaner, taking advantage of the fact that most of the opponent's Pokemon are weakened.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Shellder fits in well with Pokemon that can take hits for it after it revenge kills something. Chinchou and Magnemite can easily survive Electric-type attacks. As a bonus, Magnemite can also take Grass-type attacks, making it an excellent partner. Fighting-types tend to be bulky enough to take Icicle Spear multiple times and can thus wall Shellder. As such, a Fighting-type counter such as Trubbish can be used to switch into them and bring them down.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Shellder has access to Rapid Spin, but is greatly outclassed in the role by several other users. It can also run Substitute on the Shell Smash set to help it avoid the revenge kill, but suffers from the loss of a moveslot.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most Fighting-types have the bulk to survive an Icicle Spear or Rock Blast. They can then heal their HP back up with Drain Punch while dealing significant damage to Shellder in the process.</p>

<p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Magnemite and Chinchou resist Icicle Spear and the former also resists Rock Blast. They can then OHKO back with a STAB Thunderbolt or Volt Switch.</p>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Unless Shellder has Razor Shell, most Steel-type Pokemon will resist every one of its moves. Additionally, most Steel-types have high Defense, allowing them to wall Shellder even more effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Status moves</strong>: Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave inhibit Shellder's sweeping ability by lowering its Attack and Speed, respectively. They can be used during Shell Smash Shellder's obligatory setup turn.</p>

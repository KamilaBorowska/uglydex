<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Although Chikorita isn't generally considered a great Pokemon, it does have a small niche as the bulkiest Grass-type with access to Aromatherapy, giving it an advantage over other Grass-types fighting for a team slot. 65 base defenses mean it can take a surprising amount of hits, even from super effective moves. As a cleric, Chikorita faces stiff competition from Chinchou, Spritzee, and Lickitung, which are generally considered more useful, but Chikorita's crucial resistances to Ground and Water allow it to check Drilbur, Chinchou, Tirtouga, Corphish, and Carvanha. Although it's bulky, Chikorita lacks any sort of offensive presence, as its movepool is shallow and its attacking stats are low.</p>

<h1>Aromatherapy</h1>

<div class=set>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Because being a bulky cleric is Chikorita's main niche, Aromatherapy is the obvious first choice. Synthesis gives Chikorita a mostly reliable form of recovery. Giga Drain is the STAB move of choice, allowing Chikorita to threaten Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types and giving it a bit of extra recovery. The last move is mostly filler. Using Hidden Power Fire means that Chikorita isn't completely deadweight against opposing Grass- and Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Foongus, and Pawniard. Hidden Power Fighting is another option, still hitting Steel-types and also OHKOing Choice Scarf Pawniard after Stealth Rock. Unfortunately, Hidden Power is quite weak, but Chikorita doesn't get too many other options.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The defensive EVs give Chikorita 16 and 14 in Defense and Special Defense respectively, which become 24 and 21 after Eviolite is taken into account, allowing it to avoid the 2HKO from bulky Chinchou's Ice Beam as well as Drilbur's and Timburr's Poison Jab. Chikorita can also avoid the OHKO from powerful moves such as Amaura's Tri Attack, Fletchling's Acrobatics, and +2 Tirtouga's Stone Edge. Chikorita is bulky enough to serve as a strong physical wall to anything that does not have a super effective STAB move or that can't set up on it. Chikorita's HP stat hits 23, meaning it takes 1 less damage from Stealth Rock than if it were invested fully. 48 Special Attack EVs are necessary to 2HKO Ferroseed and Choice Scarf Pawniard with Hidden Power Fire. They also allow Chikorita to OHKO Choice Scarf Pawniard with Hidden Power Fighting.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Chikorita works as a wall that can switch into the Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types that it can easily put a stop to throughout the match, using Aromatherapy or Synthesis when needed.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that hate status and are weak to Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types appreciate Chikorita as a partner. Pawniard is an example of a Pokemon that hates being burned and needs a Pokemon to switch into Ground-type moves. Rock-types can switch into Flying- and Fire- types for Chikorita and need something to switch into Water- and Ground-types. As with most bulky Grass-type Pokemon, Chikorita works well in a Fire / Water / Grass core, due to the members' good defensive type synergy. Ponyta hates Toxic and paralysis, while bulky Tirtouga hates Toxic and burns, so they make good partners to Chikorita.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Chikorita has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, but it is often outclassed by other dual screens users. Ancient Power gives Chikorita a move to hit Fire-types with, but the move's 60 Base Power isn't going to do much damage to anything besides Larvesta. Toxic is an option to wear down bulky Pokemon Chikorita can't hurt much, such as Porygon and Ponyta. Leaf Storm is an option over Giga Drain to give Chikorita a much more powerful STAB option. Counter is an interesting move to hit physical attackers with, considering Chikorita can survive most physical hits. Chikorita's Attack is the same as its Special Attack, so Bullet Seed could be used to break Substitutes, but the added recovery from Giga Drain is almost always better.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Chikorita can't do masses of damage to most Grass-types, but Grass / Poison Pokemon such as Foongus and Bellsprout can easily switch in and hit Chikorita with a super effective STAB move, and Chikorita's Hidden Power Fire won't do too much in return.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Chikorita can't do much damage to Fire-types, so they can easily force it out.</p>

<p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Chikorita is easily forced out by Flying-types and the threat of their STAB moves.</p>

<p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types completely wall Chikorita and can hit it hard with their STAB moves.</p>

<p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Fletchling, Dragon Dance Scraggy, Bulk Up Timburr, and Calm Mind Spritzee can easily take advantage of Chikorita's lack of offensive presence to get some boosts.</p>

<p><strong>U-turn</strong>: Pokemon with U-turn cause a large amount of trouble for Chikorita: it either has to stay in and take the super effective hit, or switch out and lose momentum. </p>

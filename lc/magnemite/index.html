</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Magnemite can fill a variety of roles and hit harder than almost all other special attackers in the Little Cup metagame. Thanks to Magnemite's access to Sturdy and Recycle, it is able to keep itself healthy while dealing great damage. This sets it apart from other special attackers in the tier, such as Abra, which relies on Focus Sash to live a hit. Magnemite also has Analytic to help Choice Scarf sets hit harder when moving second. Magnemite also hits the 14 Speed tier without a Timid nature, allowing it to hold a Choice Scarf and outspeed the whole unboosted metagame. Its Steel / Electric typing gives it a lot of useful resistances, including those to Psychic, Flying, and Fairy. Magnemite's Flying-type resistance along with its ability to recover health makes it one of the best Fletching checks in Little Cup. Magnemite also has access to fantastic STAB moves in Volt Switch, Flash Cannon, and Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>However, Magnemite heavily relies on its Berry Juice or Choice Scarf, and Knock Off can eliminate Magnemite's recovery or boosted Speed, respectively. Magnemite hits only 15 Speed with a positive nature, leaving it outsped by many of the popular Pokemon in Little Cup, such as Pawniard and Drilbur. Magnemite is also weak to Fighting, a very common offensive type in Little Cup.</p>

<h1>Sturdy + Berry Juice</h1>

<div class=set>
    Magnemite @ Berry Juice<br>
    Ability: Sturdy<br>
    EVs: 36 Def / 236 SpA / 236 Spe<br>
    Modest / Timid Nature<br>
    - Volt Switch<br>- Flash Cannon<br>- Recycle<br>- Endure / Hidden Power Ground / Thunderbolt
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Volt Switch is Magnemite's primary STAB attack due to its ability to maintain momentum against Magnemite's checks and counters. Flash Cannon does decent damage to the Ground-types that come in expecting an Electric-type attack and hits Fairy-types for super effective damage. Recycle allows Magnemite to reuse its Berry Juice after consuming it, giving Magnemite reliable recovery. Endure allows Magnemite to live an attack after its Sturdy is broken and trigger its Berry Juice, allowing it to regain Sturdy. Hidden Power Ground hits incoming Chinchou that expect an Electric-type attack, and for OHKOing opposing Magnemite without their Sturdy intact. Thunderbolt is a more powerful Electric-type STAB attack that won't force Magnemite out.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The Speed EVs allow Magnemite to reach 14 Speed with a neutral nature and outspeed threats such as Adamant Corphish, while the speed EVs maximize Magnemite's damage output. The extra EVs are put in Defense to increase Magnemite's physical bulk. When Magnemite is using Hidden Power Ground over Endure or Thunderbolt, it needs to run an EV spread of 240 SpA / 236 Spe, as Hidden Power Ground lowers Magnemite's Special Attack IVs, thus requiring 4 more EVs to get the Special Attack point. A Modest nature allows Magnemite to hit harder, while a Timid nature lets it avoid Speed ties with bulkier Chinchou, Jolly Corphish, and opposing Magnemite. Sturdy allows Magnemite to live almost any move from full HP, which can give Magnemite semi-reliable recovery when paired with Berry Juice, Recycle, and Endure.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Magnemite should avoid switching in if there are entry hazards on your side of the field, as they will break Sturdy and leave it vulnerable to attacks that can OHKO it. Magnemite should avoid switching into Knock Off users such as Pawniard, because if Berry Juice gets Knocked Off, Recycle won't work anymore, leaving Magnemite without recovery. When you predict that the foe will attack when Magnemite's Sturdy is broken, Magnemite should use Endure to live and regain it's lost HP with Berry Juice. Once Pokemon that resist or are immune to Electric have been removed, Magnemite can spam Volt Switch and give your team momentum more easily. Once it has lost Sturdy, Magnemite can switch into weaker or resisted attacks from foes that don't have Knock Off, such as Spritzee and Shellder.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, Larvesta, Fletchling, and Archen, can maintain momentum and form a VoltTurn core with Magnemite. Magnemite makes good teammates with Fighting-types in general due to its ability to switch into and defeat most Fairy-types. Both Foongus and Cottonee can easily switch into Chinchou and Ground-types, Pokemon that Magnemite struggles against. Diglett is also a great teammate, as it deals with Chinchou, trapping and KOing it with a super effective Earthquake. Magnemite loves having Pokemon that can switch into Fighting-types, such as Spritzee and Trubbish, the latter of which can also switch into Knock Off because of Sticky Hold. If Endure is chosen, Toxic Spikes support from Trubbish can slowly wear down your opponents team as you stall foes out by Recycling Berry Juice. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Drilbur, Staryu, Vullaby, and Archen is incredibly useful to ensure Magnemite's Sturdy is not broken. Pokemon that struggle against Fletchling, such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Croagunk, Foongus, and Cottonee, enjoy Magnemite's presence, as it has little trouble switching into Fletchling and taking any attack it has bar Overheat, which Magnemite can survive if it uses Endure at the right time.</p>

<h1>Choice Scarf</h1>

<div class=set>
    Magnemite @ Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Sturdy / Analytic<br>
    EVs: 240 SpA / 236 Spe<br>
    Modest / Timid Nature<br>
    - Volt Switch<br>- Flash Cannon<br>- Thunderbolt<br>- Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Grass
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Volt Switch is Magnemite's primary STAB attack due to its ability to maintain momentum against Magnemite's checks and counters. Flash Cannon does decent damage to the Ground-types that come in expecting an Electric-type attack and hits Fairy-types for super effective damage. Thunderbolt is more powerful than Volt Switch and doesn't force Magnemite out, which is great when attempting to sweep your opponent's team late-game. Hidden Power Ground hits Chinchou and opposing Magnemite for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Grass hits Chinchou and Ground-types, and is great for situations where your opponent has both as without Hidden Power Grass you are forced to predict.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>With a Choice Scarf, Magnemite reaches 21 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. The EVs maximize Magnemite's Special Attack and give it 21 Speed. A Modest nature maximizes Magnemite's damage output. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon with more than 21 Speed. Sturdy allows Magnemite to survive almost any attack at full health, but Analytic can be used to hit switch-ins harder.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Locking Magnemite into an Electric-type move is a bad idea if your opponent has a Ground-type or Chinchou. Magnemite should avoid switching into Knock Off users, such as Pawniard, as losing its Choice Scarf eliminates its revenge killing capability. Use your other teammates to take out opposing Pokemon immune to Electric, thereby allowing Magnemite to gain momentum with Volt Switch more easily.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, Larvesta, Fletchling, and Archen, can maintain momentum and form a VoltTurn core with Magnemite. Magnemite makes good teammates with Fighting-types in general due to its ability to switch into and defeat most Fairy-types. Both Foongus and Cottonee can easily switch into Chinchou and Ground-types, Pokemon that Magnemite struggles against. Diglett is also a great teammate, as it deals with Chinchou, trapping and KOing it with a super effective Earthquake. Entry hazard setters such as Drilbur, Ferroseed, and Archen can help secure specific OHKOs and 2HKOs and break foes' Focus Sash or Sturdy, helping Magnemite clean late game. Magnemite also enjoys having a Pokemon that can keep entry hazards off your side of the field, such as Drilbur, Staryu, Vullaby, or Archen. Pokemon that struggle against Fletchling, such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Croagunk, Foongus, and Cottonee, enjoy Magnemite's presence, as it has little trouble switching into Fletchling and taking any attack it has bar Overheat.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Magnet Pull allows Magnemite to trap specific Pokemon and KO them with a specific Hidden Power, such as Hidden Power Fire for Ferroseed, Hidden Power Fighting for Pawniard, or Hidden Power Ground for opposing Magnemite. Discharge can be run over Thunderbolt if Magnemite can sacrifice power for a higher chance to paralyze the target. Magnemite has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, so it could run a dual screens set to support its team. Magnemite also has access to Rain Dance and Thunder, a set using which could be used on rain teams as a backup rain setter. Toxic can be used to attempt to stall foes while recovering HP with Berry Juice and Recycle. Finally, Choice Specs alongside Analytic makes Magnemite very powerful and hard to switch into.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Chinchou:</strong> Due to Volt Absorb, Chinchou gains health when switching into Magnemite's Electric-type attacks, and Chinchou is 4x resistant to Steel. However, Hidden Power Grass or Ground can do some significant damage.</p>

<p><strong>Ground-types:</strong> Ground-types can switch into Magnemite's Electric-type STAB moves and hit back with Earthquake. Drilbur bypasses Sturdy with Mold Breaker and can OHKO Magnemite. Diglett's Arena Trap prevents Magnemite from switching out, which can be particularly devastating if Magnemite is running Choice Scarf and it locked into an Electric-type move.</p>

<p><strong>Knock Off:</strong> Magnemite greatly relies on its item; as such, removing Magnemite's item leaves it completely neutered.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types:</strong> Fire-types can switch into a predicted Flash Cannon and threaten Magnemite with a super effective Fire-type move or a burn, which is a huge problem for Berry Juice variants.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting-types:</strong> Fighting-types don't have the easiest time switching into Magnemite, but once they're in, they can cripple Magnemite with Knock Off, deal damage and regain health with Drain Punch, or predict a switch and use U-turn or, in Pancham's case, Parting Shot.</p>

<p><strong>Ferroseed:</strong> Ferroseed takes significant damage from only the rare Hidden Power Fire and can set up entry hazards freely against Magnemite.</p>

<p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls:</strong> Walls such as Porygon, Lickitung, and Munchlax take very little damage from all of Magnemite's attacks and can heal off any damage taken.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards:</strong> Spikes and Stealth Rock will break Magnemite's Sturdy and leave it vulnerable to attacks that can OHKO it. </p>

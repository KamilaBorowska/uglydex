<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Golett has an impressive Attack stat for Little Cup. It also has a great movepool and a good ability in Iron Fist. Its unique typing grants it immunities to Electric-, Normal-, and Fighting-type moves. It can set Stealth Rock and block Rapid Spin at the same time, which is unique to it. There are a few downsides to using Golett, however. Despite a high HP stat, it has fairly low Defense and Special Defense stats. It is also very slow, which hinders its attacking abilities. It also has no physical Ghost-type STAB move, as Shadow Punch is illegal at level 5. Even though its unique typing grants Golett three immunities, it also unfortunately leaves Golett with several glaring weaknesses to Dark-, Ghost-, Water-, and Grass-type moves, which are pretty common.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Golett has several good options with its great movepool. Drain Punch is a reliable source of damage and recovery that is boosted by Iron Fist. Earthquake provides a STAB move with a relatively high Base Power, hitting Rock-, Steel-, and Fire-types reliably. Stealth Rock is a useful move to have on any team. Finally, Ice Punch rounds off Golett's coverage by hitting Flying-, Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types, all while being boosted by Iron Fist.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Golett's EVs and nature aim to maximize its bulk and Attack. 164 Attack EVs allow it to always OHKO certain Pokemon, such as Pawniard. With 44 HP and 196 Defense EVs, Golett has better chances of surviving attacks from some of the bigger physical threats in the tier. It has a high chance of surviving a Knock Off from Choice Scarf Pawniard, and it can take two Earthquakes from Drilbur and 2HKO in return. To round off the EVs, 76 Speed is used to outspeed other 10 Speed Pokemon, such as Porygon. Eviolite increases both of Golett's defenses and dramatically increases its overall bulk. Iron Fist increases the power of Golett's coverage moves, Drain Punch and Ice Punch.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>When using Golett, there are a few things to keep in mind. Drain Punch is always the main move to use against most targets, as it provides good coverage, as well as recovery. When in doubt, Earthquake is Golett's largest source of damage. Always resort to that as a last option. If your team doesn't already having a Pokemon running Stealth Rock, run it; it's amazingly useful. Set up Stealth Rock against support Pokemon such as Spritzee or Pokemon that Golett can tank hits from, such as Fire- and Electric-types.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Several Pokemon complement Golett well. Normal-types are immune to Ghost-type moves, so Bunnelby makes a decent teammate. As Golett blocks Rapid Spin, the only other means of removing Stealth Rock is Defog, which Pawniard would love to have hit it, so together they form a great entry hazards removal blocking duo. Any Dark-types that can tank a Knock Off and deal with Ghost-types, including Houndour, Scraggy, and Vullaby, help out Golett with its weakness. Vullaby and Houndour can also beat Grass-types that can threaten Golett. Dark-types also threaten Slowpoke, which can be a problem for Golett. Grass-types such as Foongus and Bellsprout help beat Golett's weakness to Water-types. Pokemon that can deal with Fighting-types well, such as Snubbull, Spritzee, and Trubbish, can aid in beating them for Golett. Additionally, Spritzee provides Wish support for Golett, while Trubbish provides hazard support with Spikes. Lastly, Golett works very well on Sticky Web teams, so either Surskit or Spinarak would make a good team option.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Golett has a very wide movepool, but none of the moves it learns are as useful as the ones on its main set. It has access to several good special attacks, but it has a really bad Special Attack stat. Golett can learn Superpower, which is a heavy damage dealing move to hit Dark-types. Fire Punch can be used to hit Ferroseed, as well as other Grass-types, super effectively. Meanwhile, Thunder Punch can be used to hit Flying-types and Water-types. Golett can learn Thief, so a set with Berry Juice could be useful. Rock Polish can be used to raise Golett's Speed to high levels, boosting its attacking capabilities. Rock Tomb can be used to lower opponents' Speed and hit incoming switches. Similarly, Bulldoze can be used as a STAB option that lowers the opponent's' Speed, but it is generally worse than Earthquake.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Knock Off is super effective against Golett and removes its item, which could prove to be fatal. In general, Golett does not appreciate Dark-type moves.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: As Ghost-types hit Golett super effectively with their STAB moves and Golett has no means of retaliation, it will surely be taken down or forced out by the likes of Frillish, Gastly, and Pumpkaboo.</p>

<p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Chinchou, Slowpoke, and Staryu can all threaten Golett out with a Water-type STAB move.</p>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Cottonee, Bellsprout, and Foongus pose threats to Golett with their offensive and defensive type advantages.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Hippopotas and Spritzee take minimal damage from Golett, can recover health back, and proceed to wear Golett down. </p>

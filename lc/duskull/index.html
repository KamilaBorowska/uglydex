<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>At first glance, Duskull may seem like a great wall, but due to its abysmal HP, and its weakness to the ever-present Knock Off, it makes for a mediocre wall at best. Duskull has to rely on status to kill foes, which is not a very effective strategy, as Duskull has no reliable recovery. Duskull finds itself being dead weight for most teams, as it is outclassed in almost everything it can do and cannot successfully harm most of the LC metagame. Duskull's few strengths do not outweigh its many weaknesses, leaving it a poor choice for a slot on a team. That being said, Duskull can be used effectively on some stall teams that rely on entry hazards.</p>

<h1>Utility</h1>

<div class=set>
    Duskull @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Levitate<br>
    EVs: 196 HP / 196 Def / 116 SpD<br>
    Careful Nature<br>
    - Pain Split<br>- Will-O-Wisp<br>- Substitute<br>- Shadow Sneak
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Duskull's only form of somewhat reliable recovery comes in Pain Split, and while Duskull can take a few hits, its lack of recovery can really limit how long Duskull can last. Will-O-Wisp is Duskull's most reliable way of dealing damage; it can also cripple some sweepers and limit the potential of physical wallbreakers. Substitute allows Duskull to survive a few more turns and can be used for scouting. Shadow Sneak is Duskull's best way of attacking non-passively due to its priority and Duskull's lack of other decent options. This also helps deal damage to Pokemon such as Abra who could not be damaged by Duskull otherwise.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Eviolite helps Duskull take hits much better, the EV spread hits Eviolite numbers with a Careful nature. Levitate allows Duskull to avoid Earthquakes.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Will-O-Wisp can be used to burn physical attackers, but you should try to avoid burning Pokemon with Guts such as Timburr. Try and use Substitute on obvious switches or when the opponent has no way to effectively damage Duskull. Substitute can also help to get off a more effective Pain Split. Knock Off is the bane of Duskull's existence, as it removes Duskull's item and does massive damage in the process.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off such as Mienfoo, Shellos, and Trubbish make for good teammates. Momentum-grabbing moves like U-turn and Volt Switch can effectively be used with Duskull and entry hazard setters. Duskull's niche is that as a Ghost-type, it can keep entry hazards on the field.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Curse is difficult to utilize because Duskull can be whittled down easily. Toxic isn't very useful, due to how common switches are. Rest and Sleep Talk provide what can be considered reliable recovery, but when Duskull is asleep, it becomes more of setup bait than it already is. Memento can support sweepers, but Duskull is difficult to use on fast-paced teams, due to it being counter-momentous. Hex and Shadow Ball are both STAB moves, but Duskull's low Special Attack means that these attacks will do meager damage to anything even somewhat bulky. Haze can limit setup sweepers, but most sweepers can still beat Duskull without a boost. Taunt could be used, but Duskull's low Speed will usually allow at least one setup or status move to be used before Taunt is deployed. Destiny Bond is very limited due to Duskull's abhorrent Speed.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt can leave Duskull crippled, as it can only use Shadow Sneak to defend itself.
<strong>Ghost types</strong>: Shadow Sneak does not OHKO any relevant Ghost-types, while most can OHKO or 2HKO Duskull with a super effective STAB move.
<strong>Substitute</strong>: If a Substitute user is not weak to Shadow Sneak, it can effectively shut Duskull down.
<strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers that do not care about being burned such as Omanyte, Scraggy, and Timburr will continue sweeping like nothing ever happened. As Duskull can not effectively damage them, Duskull is left as set-up bait.
<strong>Clerics and Status absorbers</strong>: Clerics and status absorbers such as Knock Off Lickitung and RestTalk Chinchou can completely shut Duskull down.
<strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types are completely immune to Will-O-Wisp and can shut Duskull down. Ponyta and Larvesta can burn and heal with Morning Sun, while Pokemon like Houndour can easily trap Duskull with Pursuit.
<strong>Knock Off</strong>: Pokemon such as Pawniard, Scraggy, and Mienfoo can use Knock Off to deal significant damage and remove Eviolite, rendering Duskull susceptible to being KOed. </p>

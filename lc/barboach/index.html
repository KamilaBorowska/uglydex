<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Barboach is extremely weak and frail, both traits that a Pokemon wouldn't want to have. This would normally lead a player to dismiss Barboach as an inferior option. However, a closer look at Barboach will reveal attributes that help it overcome these disadvantages. Barboach's typing leaves it weak to only Grass-type attacks, which means that its terrible defenses are not so easily exploited. Alongside this, Barboach can remedy its poor offensive stats with Dragon Dance, a great boosting move that boosts both its Attack and Speed, allowing it to sweep. Barboach also has a good Speed stat, letting it outspeed a good portion of the tier before a boost. Barboach's STAB attacks in Waterfall and Earthquake are both very good, and it also has Bounce to cover its weakness to Grass-types. Barboach also has the niche of being one of the best counters to Magnemite, a very common Pokemon in Little Cup.</p>

<h1>Dragon Dance</h1>

<div class=set>
    Barboach @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Oblivious<br>
    EVs: 36 HP / 212 Atk / 12 Def / 28 SpD / 196 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Dragon Dance<br>- Waterfall<br>- Earthquake<br>- Bounce
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Dragon Dance is the main move on the set, as it boosts both Attack and Speed, setting Barboach up to sweep. Waterfall and Earthquake are both STAB moves that hit relatively hard after a boost from Dragon Dance. Bounce is used to take care of Grass-type Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Oblivious is the preferred ability, as it stops Barboach from being hit with Taunt, making it easier to set up Dragon Dance. Eviolite ensures that Barboach can take hits better, letting it set up Dragon Dance more easily as well. 212 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature max out Barboach's Attack stat, which allows it to hit as hard as possible. 196 Speed EVs max out Speed with a neutral nature, allowing Barboach to outspeed the entire unboosted tier after a Dragon Dance. 36 HP EVs and 12 Defense EVs allow Barboach to take priority attacks better, as it is the most common form of attack that Barboach will be hit with while sweeping. 28 Special Defense EVs add a point to Special Defense.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Barboach can set up early game due to its wide coverage, but it's preferred that Barboach sets up late game after most of its checks are weakened or gone. Barboach is also an excellent answer to Magnemite, so it should be used as a check to it and to deter it from knocking out one of Barboach's teammates, which would allow Barboach to set up.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Barboach makes good use of entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Dwebble, as entry hazards wear down the opponent's Pokemon, which makes Barboach's sweeping job much easier. Ponyta and Fletchling make good partners, as they can get rid of bulky Grass-types that normally give Barboach trouble. Since Barboach is a perfect answer to Magnemite that lack Hidden Power Grass, as it resists both of its STAB moves and takes little damage from any of its attacks. Because of this, Pokemon such as Fletchling and Spritzee are good partners, as Barboach covers a liability for them.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Barboach is extremely lacking in other options; Dragon Dance is usually its best set. Barboach has a good special movepool with moves such as Earth Power and Hydro Pump, but while its Special Attack is almost equal to its Attack stat, it has no way of boosting it and therefore is somewhat weak. Spark is pretty weak, but it can be used to hit Mantyke. Most other Water-types, however, are already hit just as hard with Earthquake. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall for more power, but the imperfect accuracy can be costly for such a frail Pokemon.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Mantyke</strong>: Mantyke is immune to both of Barboach's STAB moves, and isn't very threatened by Bounce. However, Mantyke is hit hard with Spark.</p>

<p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Barboach is still susceptible to revenge killers such as Choice Scarf users and Focus Sash Abra.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Foongus and Cottonee can easily take a +1 Bounce and OHKO Barboach with a STAB move. Ferroseed in particular is a problem, as it can take any attack from Barboach well and can even set up hazards before it KOes.</p>

<p><strong>Water-type Immunities</strong>: Water-immune Pokemon can easily switch into a Waterfall and benefit from it. Cacnea can regain health with Water Absorb, but it must be wary of Bounce. Shellos can gain a free Special Attack boost due to Storm Drain. Lileep in particular is a problem due to its immunity to Waterfall and neutrality to both of Barboach's other attacks, as well as being able to OHKO Barboach in retaliation with Giga Drain.</p>

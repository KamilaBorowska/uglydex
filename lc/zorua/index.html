<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Zorua is a unique Pokemon in LC thanks to its ability, Illusion, which can trick the opponent into thinking it's another Pokemon, allowing it to avoid getting hit by super effective moves. Zorua also has decent Attack and Special Attack stats, and with access to both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, it can boost its stats to hit even harder. It also has a high Speed stat, which allows it to hit 17 Speed and outspeed Pok√©mon such as Pawniard. However, Zorua is very frail, and its Dark typing makes it weak to the many Fighting-types in LC. Its shallow movepool leaves it walled by Fairy-type Pokemon, which means it needs a lot of team support to help deal with these threats. However, thanks to Illusion, Zorua can avoid Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks if it copies a Poison-type Pokemon.</p>

<h1>Life Orb Attacker</h1>

</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Nasty Plot boosts Zorua's otherwise mediocre Special Attack, allowing it to sweep through teams if its counters have been worn down. Knock Off can be used instead of Nasty Plot to remove items, as Zorua won't always have the opportunity to set up. Dark Pulse is Zorua's main STAB move, though Night Daze can be used too, as it has a 40% chance to lower the opponent's accuracy. Extrasensory is Zorua's only option to to hurt Fighting-types that would otherwise wall Zorua. U-turn is also another option to hurt Dark-types and gain offensive momentum, while Hidden Power Fighting can be used to deal with Dark-types, notably Pawniard, that might be a problem.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>This set uses Life Orb to help Zorua deal more damage, and with maximum investment and positive nature, it hits 17 Speed, which allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Pawniard. 0 HP IVs are used to make Life Orb recoil deal only one HP.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Zorua uses Illusion to keep super effective moves away; it mainly disguises itself as a Poison-type to keep Fairy-, Fighting-, and Bug-type attacks away and trick the opponent into using Psychic-type attacks. If Zorua is using Nasty Plot, it's preferable to not set up with Zorua until its checks and counters have been removed so that it can sweep without the fear of being revenge killed. Instead, try to set up when a Pokemon is forced out by whatever Zorua is disguised by. Also, it's preferred that Zorua is at full health, as a difference in HP between it and the Pokemon it's copying might let the opponent know that it's actually Zorua.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Dwebble and Tirtouga can assist Zorua in sweeping. Another great example is Trubbish, as it's able to set up Spikes and also deal with Fairy- and Fighting-types; in return, Zorua deals with Psychic-types that threaten Trubbish. Hazard removers such as Drilbur and Archen are also important, as the damage received from entry hazards might ruin Illusion. Fletchling and other Flying-type Pokemon are also great teammates, as they help take down Fighting-types. Pokemon that can take down Fairy-types that Zorua cannot deal with are also necessary; examples include Magnemite, Pawniard, Trubbish, and Gastly.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>A Swords Dance set with Knock Off, Sucker Punch, and U-turn can also be used. Agility is an option to double Zorua's Speed, but Zorua lacks the raw power to sweep without boosts in its Attack or Special Attack stat, and it also has access to priority in Sucker Punch. Zorua can use Taunt, but most of its counters don't really have a problem with being Taunted, as they usually choose to attack and target Zorua's low defenses. Memento can be used to give the opportunity for a setup sweeper to come in and set up safely. Pursuit is also an option to trap Pokemon such as Gastly while disguised as a Pokemon that threatens the foe. Zorua can also use a Choice Scarf set with Trick.</p>

<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types can deal with Zorua unless it has Extrasensory. Priority Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave from Timburr and Croagunk, respectively, deal a lot of damage to Zorua. Scraggy is also a nice counter as it's immune to Extrasensory.</p>

<p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubull can wall Zorua and take it down with Moonblast and Play Rough, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Zorua cannot beat Dark-type Pokemon such as Vullaby that can tank its attacks. Pawniard also deals with Zorua as long as it doesn't carry Hidden Power Fighting.</p>

<p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users can easily revenge kill Zorua because of its low defenses; faster Pokemon can also play the same role but some such as Gastly must be wary of Sucker Punch.</p>

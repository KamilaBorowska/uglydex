<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Sandile's unique STAB type combination is resisted by just two Pokemon in the entire LC metagame: Cottonee and Vullaby. Sandile has access to a powerful ability in Moxie. With Moxie, Sandile steadily gains strength when sweeping and becomes very powerful after a boost. Its movepool is also quite extensive, including moves such as Fire Fang and Aqua Tail. It is also quite fast, making it an effective Choice Scarf user. To top it all off, Sandile can provide useful Pursuit support. However, Sandile also has many weaknesses to many common types. Its lack of bulk also means it can't take priority hits, and it's even weak to a few priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Ice Shard. Sandile faces stiff competition from Pawniard and Drilbur as Dark- and Ground-type sweepers. It is also very easily worn down by status and entry hazards, and its lack of power before Moxie boosts also means that Sandile struggles to break through walls. Finally, Sandile lacks access to Knock Off, unlike other Dark-types.</p>

<h1>Choice Scarf</h1>

<div class=set>
    Sandile @ Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Moxie<br>
    EVs: 180 Atk / 76 Def / 236 Spe<br>
    Adamant / Jolly Nature<br>
    - Earthquake<br>- Crunch<br>- Fire Fang<br>- Pursuit / Stone Edge
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Earthquake is a very powerful STAB move that Sandile can utilize to clean up weakened teams. Crunch adds to Sandile's great coverage, hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types hard. Fire Fang is used to break through Ferroseed and Cottonee, while providing nice all-around coverage. Pursuit is useful for trapping Psychic- and Ghost-types, but Stone Edge can be used instead to hit Flying-types attempting to switch into Earthquake.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The listed EVs give Sandile the highest Attack and Speed possible, while adding an additional point to Defense. Choice Scarf bolsters Sandile's Speed and gives it a chance to sweep when coupled with Moxie. An Adamant nature is preferred to make Sandile as hard hitting as possible, since Adamant Choice Scarf Sandile still outspeeds most of the metagame with its 24 Speed; however, a Jolly nature can be used if Sandile needs to outspeed Choice Scarf Chinchou. Choice Band and Life Orb are also candidates for items, but the immediate Speed provided by Choice Scarf is much more beneficial.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Sandile must be wary of being locked into certain moves; for example, Earthquake should be used sparingly when the opponent carries a Flying-type, and the same goes for using Crunch when the opponent has a Fairy-type, etc. Try to avoid being locked into Fire Fang and Pursuit if possible, as these moves are not very powerful without boosts, and Sandile does not always have the luxury of attaining a boost. Bringing Sandile in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is needed, as it lacks bulk and has many weaknesses. Walls should be broken down early game so Sandile has an easier time sweeping late-game. Don't attempt to set up Moxie boosts early on in the match, as Sandile will often not be powerful enough to steamroll opposing teams by itself.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Ghost-types, such as Mienfoo and Bunnelby, make good partners. Trubbish is a good partner because it provides Spikes support to wear down the opposition and resists Sandile's Fighting-, Fairy-, and Grass-type weaknesses; Sandile can take Psychic-type moves in return. Pawniard provides Knock Off support, removing opponents' Eviolites, which is crucial for Sandile because it needs the support to break through bulkier Pokemon. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Archen and Dwebble is helpful to wear down Flying-type Pokemon attempting to switch into Earthquake. Fairy-types, such as Spritzee and Snubbull, are good partners to handle Dark-, Fighting-, and Bug-types for Sandile.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Thunder Fang hits potential Water-type switch-ins and Vullaby, but it has little use outside of this. Choice Band can make Sandile very powerful, but the Speed provided by Choice Scarf is much more appreciated; in a similar vein, Life Orb can be used, but the recoil from Life Orb wears down Sandile very quickly. Stealth Rock can be used, although Sandile lacks the bulk to properly set it up. Hone Claws is Sandile's only form of boosting its Attack outside of Moxie and makes Stone Edge much more reliable. Aqua Tail gets nice coverage, although it is fairly weak against Pokemon it is neutral against. Foul Play is an interesting move, but Crunch's reliability is often preferred. Finally, Iron Tail puts massive hurt on Fairy-types; however, it is very unreliable and gets horrible coverage otherwise.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types resist Crunch and often have the bulk to tank Sandile's other moves.</p>

<p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Fighting-, Grass-, Ice-, and Water-type moves all put a serious hurt on Sandile. Grass-types work especially well because they resist Earthquake; Cottonee also resists Crunch.</p>

<p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types are immune to Earthquake and can set up on Choice-locked Sandile.</p>

<p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Passive damage such as Spikes wears Sandile down because it lacks reliable recovery. Will-O-Wisp in particular completely ruins its sweep and wears it down quickly.</p>

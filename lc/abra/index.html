<h1>Tiers</h1>
<ul class=nav>
<li><a href='/uglydex/lc/abra'>LC</a>
</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Abra's base 105 Special Attack stat is the highest in the tier, only matched by that of Solosis. Abra is also extremely fast, reaching the invaluable 19 Speed tier, which allows it to outspeed the majority of the metagame. While the generation shift brought in a lot of new Dark-types, it also granted Abra the new Fairy-type attack Dazzling Gleam, allowing it to maim the Dark-types that would otherwise KO it with ease. Abra's ability, Magic Guard, allows it to effectively utilize a Focus Sash to become a revenge killer, hitting a good amount of threats super effectively. However, Abra's Psychic typing and terrible defenses really limit what it can do, as it has to constantly be wary of Sucker Punch users and Choice Scarf users, which can easily KO it, even with neutral attacks.</p>

<h1>Focus Sash</h1>

<div class=set>
    Abra @ Focus Sash<br>
    Ability: Magic Guard<br>
    EVs: 240 SpA / 200 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Psychic<br>- Dazzling Gleam<br>- Hidden Power Fighting<br>- Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Psychic is Abra's most powerful and reliable STAB move, allowing Abra to revenge kill Fighting- and Poison-type threats. Dazzling Gleam allows it to hit Dark-types, which are immune to Psychic, and Hidden Power Fighting is great for hitting Pawniard and Houndour super effectively, as they are only hit neutrally by Dazzling Gleam. Finally, Protect is used to stop nasty Fake Out users that threaten to nullify Abra's Focus Sash.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Thanks to Magic Guard and Focus Sash, Abra cannot be OHKOed. As such, this set works best as a failsafe countermeasure against setup sweepers. It is also incredibly powerful and fast, so it can be useful late-game to heavily pressure the opponent. The EVs are used to maximize Abra's Speed and damage output, as its subpar defenses are unsalvageable. A Timid nature should be used because it allows Abra to hit 19 Speed, giving it the ability to outspeed the majority of the metagame.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>As it might lose its Focus Sash in the process, Abra should never be directly switched into an attack. Most attacks, even neutrally effective ones, will take out a good chunk of its health. Abra is great at revenge killing setup sweepers such as Scraggy, so keeping its Focus Sash intact is very important. Once Abra has had its Focus Sash broken, it must be wary of Choice Scarf users, which can outspeed and defeat it before it has a chance to attack. Priority moves, particularly Sucker Punch, are also very threatening to Abra.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>This set is most effective on hyper offensive teams that have a hard time dealing with setup sweepers. Slow Volt Switch or U-turn users, such as Nosepass and Chinchou, help Abra get on the field without having to take any damage. Pokemon that can deal with Dark-types, especially Pursuit or Sucker Punch users, make for good partners as well; Fairy-types, such as Spritzee and Cottonee, and Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Timburr, work well in this role. Fighting-types are able to take care of Normal-types like Porygon and Munchlax, whose high Special Defense stats make them good checks to Abra.</p>

<h1>Life Orb</h1>

<div class=set>
    Abra @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Magic Guard<br>
    EVs: 240 SpA / 200 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Psychic<br>- Dazzling Gleam<br>- Hidden Power Fighting<br>- Substitute / Energy Ball
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Psychic and Dazzling Gleam get good coverage with each other, which is rounded off by Hidden Power Fighting. Unlike the Focus Sash set, Abra won't be able to survive hits from most setup sweepers, so it needs coverage to maximize its power. As Abra naturally forces a lot of switches, Substitute is its best option for a fourth move, putting pressure on the foe to attack and often allowing it to safely get a 2HKO. Additionally, Substitute protects it from Sucker Punch, which would otherwise KO it. Energy Ball can be used to OHKO defensive Tirtouga and non-Eviolite Chinchou.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>This set is designed to hit as fast and hard as possible. With the given EVs, Abra reaches a mighty 20 Special Attack and hits 19 Speed, letting it outspeed most unboosted Pokemon, such as Gastly. Life Orb makes Abra's moves much more powerful, and its recoil is nullified by Magic Guard. Due to Abra's extreme power, not a lot of Pokemon will be able to stand up to an attack from it, making it a good wallbreaker.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Like the Focus Sash set, Abra is too frail to be switched in, so coming in to revenge kill or through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn is desirable. If you predict that the enemy will switch out, Substitute is the best option, putting the opponent in an unfavorable situation. It can also help protect Abra from Dark-types that might try to trap it with Pursuit or KO it with Sucker Punch. Basically, prediction is the key to victory with Abra, as it can easily 2HKO most Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>This set is good for hyper offensive teams that need to be able to break through walls, as Abra can easily deal with them. Abra usually has trouble dealing with Ghost-types, so Normal-types such as Porygon and Munchlax are helpful; in return, Abra can scare away Fighting-types, which threaten them. Fighting- and Fairy-types make for good partners as well, being able to counter Dark-types, which are immune to Abra's STAB moves. Additionally, slow U-turn and Volt Switch users can help Abra get into battle without taking too much damage.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Abra gets Charge Beam to deal a little damage and boost its Special Attack, but Abra is very frail, making the move not worth it; this is also the case with Calm Mind. Abra can set up dual screens and has a fast Encore to help it set up. Abra also has access to Psyshock to catch Munchlax off guard, but Psyshock misses a guaranteed OHKO on some common Pokemon, such as Timburr, if Abra is not running Life Orb. A Choice Scarf set with Trick could be interesting and is useful for revenge killing faster threats like Dragon Dance Scraggy and other Choice Scarf users. Finally, on the Focus Sash set, Thunder Wave can be useful for crippling boosted threats that Abra wouldn't otherwise be able to OHKO, such as Tirtouga and Dwebble.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Some Dark-types, like Pawniard, Stunky, and Houndour, are immune to Psychic-type attacks and hit neutrally by Fairy-type attacks, making it difficult for Abra to KO them. They put a lot of pressure on Abra with their super effective attacks, especially Sucker Punch. Carvanha, while quite frail and not resistant to Dazzling Gleam, can accumulate Speed boosts with Protect until it is able to outspeed Abra and KO it with Crunch. Knock Off provides Abra with a means of removing bulkier foes' items, letting it KO them or prepare for an ally to clean later.</p>

<p><strong>Munchlax</strong>: Munchlax has enough special bulk to survive virtually everything Abra can launch at it, including Hidden Power Fighting. It is also capable of trapping Abra with Pursuit or slowing it down with Body Slam's paralysis.</p>

<p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: As long as Abra has lost its Focus Sash, Choice Scarf users will be able to take advantage of its low defenses to get an easy KO.</p>

<p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Due to Abra's reliance on its Speed, paralysis greatly hinders its ability to perform. Slowpoke and Porygon can survive any of Abra's attacks and spread Thunder Wave while ultimately healing any lost health back with Regenerator and Recover, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Sticky Web</strong>: Magic Guard does not protect against the Speed drop from Sticky Web, and the Bug-types that set up Sticky Web are capable of picking off Abra with their STAB moves. </p>

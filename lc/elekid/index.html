<h1>Tiers</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href='/uglydex/lc/elekid'>LC</a>
</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Elekid is very fast, hitting 20 Speed, which is the fastest unboosted Speed tier in the metagame. However, Elekid is also extremely frail, meaning that it can't switch in as often as it would like to and it is ripped apart by priority moves, which plague the tier. Thankfully for Elekid, sand is not as important as it was in BW, boosting Elekid's viability to an extent.</p>

<h1>Special</h1>

<div class=set>
    Elekid @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Static<br>
    EVs: 240 SpA / 236 Spe<br>
    Timid / Hasty Nature<br>
    - Thunderbolt<br>- Volt Switch<br>- Psychic / Substitute / Cross Chop<br>- Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Grass
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Thunderbolt is used as Elekid's main STAB move, while Volt Switch is used for scouting early-game and acting as a decent pivot. Psychic is a decent coverage option, as it 2HKOes Foongus, one of the most common switch-ins to Elekid. Substitute is an excellent move to use on Elekid, as it allows Elekid to bypass Sucker Punch and eliminate the Pokemon using it, as well as defeat Carvanha. Elekid can also become a decent mixed attacker by using Cross Chop. Hidden Power Ground is generally the best choice of Hidden Power, as it hits Chinchou and Magnemite, which would normally wall Elekid, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Grass can be used to maintain coverage against Chinchou, while also hitting Ground-types such as Drilbur for super effective damage.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>236 Special Attack and 236 Speed EVs maximize Elekid's Speed and Special Attack, while 0 IVs in HP make it so that Elekid only loses 1 HP after taking damage from Life Orb recoil. A Timid nature allows Elekid to hit 20 Speed, although Elekid should use a Hasty nature and 12 Attack EVs if it uses Cross Chop. Static is the preferred ability, as Elekid will lose to Foongus anyways and Static gives Elekid a clutch chance to paralyze a Pokemon that makes contact, sometimes supporting the team even when Elekid is KOed. Elekid should not use Choice Specs over Life Orb.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Because Elekid is extremely frail, it is important to use it as a revenge killer. Elekid should not be switching into anything, as it will likely be KOed. It is also important to always use Volt Switch if Elekid is in a bad match-up or switch out if the opposing Pokemon has priority.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Diglett is able to trap and KO opposing Electric-types such as Chinchou, as well as other common switch-ins to Elekid. Drilbur can preform a similar role as Diglett, but it does not have the ability to trap opponents. However, while they both have access to Stealth Rock, Drilbur also boasts Rapid Spin to support Elekid. Staryu and other bulky Water-types can KO Ground-types such as Diglett, Drilbur, and Hippopotas, but Staryu can also give Rapid Spin support. Poison-types such as Croagunk, Trubbish, and Koffing are also useful as they can wall and defeat both Foongus and Cottonee. Fire-types such as Ponyta, Houndour, and Larvesta can also be used to eliminate Grass-types. They also have the added bonus of defeating Ferroseed, which walls Elekid lacking Cross Chop with ease. Mienfoo and Fletchling can help form a decent VoltTurn core with Elekid. Knock Off users like Pawniard are very good partners, as they can remove Berry Juice from Pokemon with Sturdy and Eviolite from bulky Pokemon such as Chinchou and Foongus, which helps to wear them down faster. Entry hazard users are also important partners, as they make walls easier to break down by dealing passive damage to them.</p>

<h1>Physical</h1>

<div class=set>
    Elekid @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Static / Vital Spirit<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 236 Spe<br>
    Hasty Nature<br>
    - Wild Charge<br>- Cross Chop<br>- Fire Punch<br>- Volt Switch
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Wild Charge is Elekid's strongest physical STAB move, while Volt Switch is used to pivot and scout. Cross Chop is Elekid's best coverage move, as Fighting- and Electric-type moves have good coverage together. Fire Punch also provides good coverage by hitting common Grass-type switch-ins, but it is mostly a filler.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>252 Attack and 236 Speed EVs maximize physical offensive stats, while 0 HP IVs minimize Life Orb recoil. A Hasty nature is chosen so as not to reduce Volt Switch's damage, but a Jolly nature can be used if Elekid is not using Volt Switch. Static is the best ability once again, as Elekid will always lose to Foongus and the chance to paralyze can be very crucial in certain moments.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Elekid should be played a bit more cautiously with this set. This is because Elekid is extremely frail, while also being worn down quickly by both Life Orb and Wild Charge recoil. Elekid is best used as a revenge killer and should never switch into powerful attacks. Also, be sure to pivot around with Elekid early-game and always switch out of any priority attacks aimed at it.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Diglett is able to trap and KO Chinchou, while also supporting Elekid with Stealth Rock. Drilbur does the same as Diglett, but cannot trap the opponent. However, it does have Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock to support Elekid. Staryu and other bulky Water-types can KO Ground-types such as Diglett, Drilbur, and Hippopotas, but Staryu also gives Rapid Spin support. Poison-types such as Croagunk, Trubbish and Koffing can wall and defeat both Foongus and Cottonee, although it isn't as important to use them as partners for this set. Fletchling and Mienfoo can form a decent VoltTurn core, assuming that Elekid is using Volt Switch. Knock Off users can help Elekid out a lot as they make it easier for Elekid to break down walls. Entry hazard users are also important partners, as they make walls easier to break down by dealing passive damage to them.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Cross Chop can be replaced with Brick Break if you have accuracy concerns. However, this is not advised on the special set, as Brick Break misses out on many of the KOes that Cross Chop provides. Meditate, Ice Punch, Quick Attack, and Thief are options on the physical set as well, but are generally not great moves due to either four-moveslot syndrome or inferior coverage. Even with Ice Punch, for example, Elekid will still lose to Ground-types. Focus Punch is also an interesting move that Elekid has access to and can be used with Substitute over Volt Switch and Cross Chop on the physical set. Signal Beam is an option on the special set, but it provides inferior coverage. Elekid also has access to both Discharge and Thunder Wave, but Elekid lacks the bulk to spread paralysis well and its common switch-ins don't care about paralysis. Again, Substitute is another interesting option to use on Elekid.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Diglett</strong>: Diglett traps and Speed ties with Elekid. It can either OHKO Elekid with Earthquake after its Focus Sash is used, assuming that Elekid wins the Speed tie, or eliminate a weakened Elekid with Sucker Punch.</p>

<p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Drilbur and Hippopotas can both wall and OHKO Elekid. Drilbur can also set up on Elekid with Swords Dance.</p>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Foongus, Ferroseed, and Cottonee are able to wall Elekid. However, Foongus is 2HKOed by Psychic, while Cottonee must watch out for Fire Punch and Ice Punch.</p>

<p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou walls Elekid and can 2HKO it with Scald.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Special Walls</strong>: Walls such as Porygon, Lickitung, Munchlax, and Spritzee can take multiple assaults from Elekid's special set, while they can easily 2HKO Elekid with their STAB attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: These Pokemon can use Elekid as setup bait, as they are able to take a majority of Elekid's attacks with ease. They then recover back to full HP with Berry Juice. Magnemite can eliminate Elekid with Hidden Power Ground after Life Orb recoil, Onix completely walls Elekid, Dwebble can use Elekid as setup bait for entry hazards, and other Sturdy Pokemon can use it as setup bait for Shell Smash.</p>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: With Elekid's blaring frailty, it's not hard to see why priority easily checks it. Strong priority users such as Timburr, Fletchling, and Pawniard easily 2HKO most of Elekid's sets.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entry hazards wear Elekid down, and when taking Life Orb recoil into account, it won't be able to switch in and pivot around as much as it would like to, limiting Elekid's survivability.</p>

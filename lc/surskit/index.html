<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>In the transition to a new generation, Surskit gained an excellent movepool addition in Sticky Web. As opposed to other entry hazards setters, Surskit can actually beat Drilbur. Surskit can reach a Speed of 17, allowing it to tie with Pokemon such as Drilbur and maximum speed Mienfoo, while also outspeeding a large majority of the tier. Its 17 Speed allows Surskit to revenge kill slower offensive teams. However, Surskit is pretty weak, even with an excellent Water STAB in Hydro Pump. In addition, Surskit is not bulky at all, so if the opponent's team carries any form of hazard control, Surskit must be played conservatively until the opponent's Defogger/Spinner is eliminated. Sticky Web is not the most reliable hazard either, as many Pokemon, such as Gastly, Fletchling, and Archen, are immune to Sticky Web's effects. Pawniard can even take advantage of Sticky Web's speed drop and possibly sweep thanks to Defiant.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Sticky Web is the only reason to use Surskit, thus making it the most important move. Hydro Pump is Surskit's strongest move, and is the best to use if Surskit is delegated to being a revenge killer. Scald is an option that has better accuracy than Hydro Pump and a 30% Burn chance, which can cripple physical attackers. Ice Beam hits Foongus and Cottonee harder than any other move and is also a safe option against Pokemon such as Drilbur if Hydro Pump is used. Baton Pass allows Surskit to scout for the opponent's move, although Protect can also be used to the same effect. Protect can also scout for Pokemon such as Taunt Mienfoo that want to stop Surskit from doing its job, and can protect against Fake Out users.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>With the above spread, Speed and Special Attack are maximized to allow Surskit to be as effective of a revenge killer, while getting Sticky Web up as fast as possible. With Timid, Surskit hits 17 Speed, allowing it to tie with maximum Speed Drilbur and Taunt Mienfoo. Focus Sash is always the preferred item, as this allows Surskit to almost always get Sticky Web up first turn.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Unless you have a dedicated counter to Pawniard, if the opponent is using Pawniard, do not set Sticky Web until it dies because Defiant will give it a +2 Attack boost. Similarly, if the opponent has a Defog user or spinner that can easily come in and get rid of Sticky Web, it's best to conserve Surskit until the opponent's hazard control is eliminated. If Sticky Web will not be useful throughout the match, feel free to keep Surskit as a backup revenge killer.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that are moderately slow, yet strong, make the best partners for Surskit. Life Orb Bunnelby, Life Orb Mienfoo, and Swords Dance Pawniard, are all great Pokemon for this role. Defiant Pawniard is an excellent answer to Sticky Web teams, so Pokemon that can easily switch in and threaten it are good partners. Mienfoo, Croagunk, and Timburr can all abuse Sticky Web as well, while forcing Pawniard out with their STAB Fighting attacks. Frillish is a solid spinblocker to keep the opponent from spinning away your Sticky Web. Pawniard is a great answer, hitting 16 Speed so it outspeeds most Pokemon that will switch into Sticky Web. Pawniard can also take advantage of Defog from Pokemon such as Vullaby by getting a +2 Attack boost thanks to Defiant.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Surskit can use an offensive Swift Swim set, but it is outclassed by other Swift Swim Pokemon, such as Omanyte or Kabuto. However, with a Focus Sash, it can set up Rain Dance for its teammates. Sticky Web is often more useful though, as it lasts the whole match provided the opponent doesn't carry a form of hazard control. Giga Drain can be used as an alternative move to hit Tirtouga. Icy Wind can be used over Ice Beam, although the power loss is not worth it, especially since the opponent might be at -1 Speed from Sticky Web. Struggle Bug can similarly be used, but this detracts from Surskit's viability as a revenge killer. Thief is an option on Surskit, and, if used, 0 HP, 0 Defense, and 0 Special Defense IVs should be used so as to allow Surskit's Focus Sash to break more often. Haze can be used as a final filler, and can be used to abuse Surskit's 17 Speed in order to stop boosters such as Bulk Up Timburr and Bulk Up/Nasty Plot Croagunk.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Hazard Control</strong>: Spinners such as Drilbur or Staryu can easily spin away Sticky Web over the course of a match. Defoggers such as Archen or Vullaby can also remove entry hazards, and they do not get the speed drop.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users such as Aipom and Cottonee can stop Surskit from setting up Sticky Web, and in general do not fear Surskit's attacks. Cottonee only has to worry about Ice Beam.</p>

<p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Mienfoo can often tie with Surskit can KO it with a combination of Fake Out + Knock Off, or just Taunt it. Fletchling can hit with a super effective Acrobatics, which will always KO after Surskit's sash is broken.</p>

<p><strong>Dwebble</strong>: Dwebble can anti-lead against Surskit and always beat it one-on-one with Rock Blast breaking its Focus Sash. Dwebble can also set up its own entry hazards in order to hamper the opponent team.</p>

<p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard can take the Speed drop and and use the Attack boost to punch holes in Sticky Web offensive teams.</p>

<p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Croagunk can use Surskit as set up bait for its more offensive sets, Bulk Up and Nasty Plot. Croagunk is slow anyway, so it doesn't mind the Speed drop.</p>

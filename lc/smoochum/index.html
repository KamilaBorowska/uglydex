<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The pre-evolution of everyone's favorite Pokemon, Smoochum is rather interesting with its unique Psychic / Ice typing. It has a very good offensive typing for dealing with common Fighting-, Flying-, and Poison-types in the tier. It has the highest Special Attack stat of any Ice-type in the tier. Smoochum's ability, Oblivious, means it cannot be affected by Taunt, and it can take advantage of this with setup moves such as Substitute and Nasty Plot. It also has a decent 17 Speed. However, there are some downsides to using this little cutie. It has absolutely terrible defenses, and anything with a super effective move will probably take it out. On top of this, its Ice typing leaves it weak to entry hazards. Unlike its evolution, Jynx, it does not have access to Lovely Kiss. Along with its poor defenses, Smoochum is also plagued with terrible weaknesses to the common Dark-, Bug-, Fire-, Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types, and only resists Psychic- and Ice-type moves.</p>

<h1>Setup</h1>

<div class=set>
    Smoochum @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Oblivious<br>
    EVs: 240 SpA / 240 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Ice Beam<br>- Psychic<br>- Hidden Power Fighting / Shadow Ball<br>- Substitute / Nasty Plot
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Ice Beam and Psychic are the main STAB moves, which hit common threats such as Vullaby, Timburr, Mienfoo, and Croagunk. Substitute allows Smoochum to safely avoid status, and possibly gain a free turn. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can boost Smoochum's already amazing Special Attack even higher. Hidden Power Fighting deals with the Dark- and Steel-types that would otherwise counter Smoochum, such as Pawniard, Aron, Shieldon, Houndour, and Magnemite. Shadow Ball is another option that can catch Slowpoke and other Psychic-types off-guard.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>240 Special Attack EVs give Smoochum a great deal of power. 240 Speed EVs along with a Timid nature allow to hit a valuable 17 Speed, which is great in Little Cup. This Speed allows Smoochum to outspeed most non-Choice Scarf Pokemon as well as Speed tie with threats like Mienfoo. With 0 HP IVs, it takes minimal damage from Life Orb recoil.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Setting up, preferably with Memento or dual screens support from a teammate, should always be the focus of this set, as a Nasty Plot or Substitute is necessary for proper sweeping. Avoid priority moves at all costs as they hurt Smoochum greatly.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Many Pokemon complement Smoochum nicely, and it has an abundance of well-suited teammates. Houndour makes an especially good teammate, as it can absorb Fire-type moves, resists Dark-, Ghost-, and Steel-type moves, and Smoochum can check Fighting-types for it. Smoochum appreciates entry hazards just as much as any other Pokemon, so a Pokemon with Stealth Rock or Spikes, such as Ferroseed, can help immensely. Smoochum appreciates Rapid Spin support even more, due to its frailty and weakness to Stealth Rock. A physically bulky Rapid Spinner or Defogger can clear hazards for Smoochum while also taking hits for it. A good option would be either Tentacool to take Bug- or Fire-type moves, or Drilbur to take Rock-type moves and check Steel-types such as Honedge and Pawniard. Archen is also a good choice as it can Defog and use U-turn to keep offensive momentum. Along with entry hazards, Smoochum also needs substantial team support, such as a dual screens user, to help it take hits and set up with Substitute or Nasty Plot.</p>

<h1>Choice Scarf</h1>

<div class=set>
    Smoochum @ Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Oblivious<br>
    EVs: 240 SpA / 240 Spe<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Psychic<br>- Ice Beam<br>- Hidden Power Fighting / Shadow Ball<br>- Trick
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Psychic and Ice Beam are the main STAB moves to either revenge kill Pokemon or hit them extremely hard. Shadow Ball hits opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Slowpoke and Wynaut, while Hidden Power Fighting hits pesky Dark- and Steel-types. Lastly, Trick can cripple an opponent and afterwards allow Smoochum to switch moves if it needs to.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>With a Choice Scarf, Smoochum is able to hit extremely hard and become a powerful revenge killer. It can Trick its Choice Scarf to cripple opponents, giving away its item in exchange for a possibly better one. With 240 EVs in Special Attack, its attacks can put a dent in any team. It also has 240 Speed EVs to hit 16 Speed, which the Choice Scarf boosts to 24 Speed. A Modest nature is preferred to boost Smoochum's already amazing Special Attack even higher, as 24 Speed is enough to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Revenge killing is the job of the Choice Scarf set, and it can be used late-game to finish teams off or to cripple a single opponent. Bear in mind that Smoochum will be locked into a single move, so prediction is key. It should Trick away its Choice Scarf onto foes that threaten the rest of your team, or on a predicted ineffective move like Sucker Punch. Smoochum should always try to come into battle unscathed, so make sure that all entry hazards have been removed.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Smoochum appreciates entry hazards just as much as any other Pokemon, so a Pokemon with Stealth Rock or Spikes can help greatly. Trubbish is a good teammate as it can check Pawniard as well as set up Spikes for Smoochum. It also appreciates Rapid Spin support. A physically bulky Rapid Spinner or Defogger can clear entry hazards for Smoochum, while also taking hits for it. A good option would be Tentacool to take Bug- or Fire-type moves, or Drilbur to take Rock-type moves and check Steel-types such as Honedge and Pawniard. Snover works well with Smoochum as its hail allows Smoochum to use Blizzard as a hard-hitting, perfectly accurate STAB move. Houndour once again makes a great teammate, as it absorbs Fire-type moves, resists Dark- and Steel-type moves, and appreciates Smoochum's ability to check Fighting-types.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Even though Smoochum seems like it would be a Pokemon with many viable options, there are in fact not many other possibilities for it. It can run a dual screens set, but is highly outclassed in this role. It also has access to Wish, but cannot utilize it as well as bulkier Pokemon like Lickitung. Smoochum can use a different Hidden Power type according to its team's needs, but Hidden Power Fighting is normally best. A Calm Mind set is usable, but it is generally outclassed by Nasty Plot due to Smoochum's low defenses. With its rare access to Perish Song, Smoochum can force a switch at the cost of a coverage move. Hail and Blizzard can be used on a bulkier set to annoy opposing Pokemon while maintaining a powerful, perfectly accurate STAB move. Lastly, Smoochum has access to Heal Bell, but once again it is severely outclassed by bulkier alternatives.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard can switch in on either of Smoochum's STAB moves with relative ease and can force a switch if Smoochum does not have Hidden Power Fighting. Even with Hidden Power Fighting, Smoochum loses to Sucker Punch unless it also carries Substitute. Choice Scarf Pawniard can easily outspeed and KO Smoochum with Iron Head or Knock Off.</p>

<p><strong>Honedge</strong>: Honedge can come in on anything Smoochum has to throw at it, fearing only the rare Shadow Ball. It does not fear Hidden Power Fighting like other Steel-types, and can OHKO with Shadow Sneak without worrying about Choice Scarf or Shadow Ball.</p>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Most Dark-types, such as Houndour, Pawniard, and Carvanha, can check Smoochum if they can get a free switch-in.</p>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types will not take much damage from any of Smoochum's moves other than Hidden Power Fighting. Some can easily take a Hidden Power Fighting and check Smoochum back with a super effective STAB move or wall it entirely.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types can usually beat Smoochum one-on-one, as they are typically faster and can OHKO it. Ponyta can come in on anything but a Choice Scarfed Psychic. Houndour resists Ice Beam, is unaffected by Psychic, and only fears Hidden Power Fighting. It also has access to Sucker Punch, which can take care of Smoochum as long as it's not behind a Substitute. </p>

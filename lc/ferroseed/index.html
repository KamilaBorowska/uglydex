<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Ferroseed excels at stacking entry hazards and being an altogether reliable wall. It is one of the better entry hazard users in the metagame, only truly competing with Dwebble and sometimes Trubbish. With an excellent typing, it can check common setup sweepers such as Tirtouga. However, its typing can also be its downfall, leaving it vulnerable to top threats like Pawniard and Scraggy that will use it as setup fodder. Being neutral to Knock Off is not beneficial, as Ferroseed greatly appreciates its Eviolite. Having mediocre offenses does not help either, as anything that resists one of its attacks can set up on it.</p>

<h1>Utility</h1>

<div class=set>
    Ferroseed @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Iron Barbs<br>
    EVs: 84 HP / 36 Atk / 188 Def / 148 SpD / 36 Spe<br>
    Careful Nature<br>
    - Leech Seed<br>- Bullet Seed<br>- Stealth Rock / Spikes<br>- Thunder Wave / Protect / Spikes
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Leech Seed is one of the staple moves on Ferroseed, as it allows Ferroseed to gain small passive recovery, and also happens to be Ferroseed's most viable recovery option. Bullet Seed is the STAB move of choice, and it helps break Substitutes and beat Sturdy Tirtouga. Due to Ferroseed's incredible bulk, it has an easy time setting up entry hazards. Stealth Rock is the preferred hazard, only requiring one turn of setup, though Spikes can be used as well. Thunder Wave is the preferred move in the fourth moveslot, allowing Ferroseed to check Pokemon that might try and set up on it. It also allows Ferroseed to cripple any switch-ins. Protect can also be used in order to scout the opponent's moves, play mind games, and rack up Leech Seed damage.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Eviolite is always the preferred item for Ferroseed, giving it massive bulk. With the current EV spread, Ferroseed has defenses of 22 HP / 18 Def / 18 SpD, which is massive when paired with an Eviolite. Eviolite works extremely well because of Ferroseed's semi-reliable recovery in Leech Seed. Eviolite allows Ferroseed to take more hits overall, even to the point of sponging certain super effective attacks.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>The safest time to bring in Ferroseed is against Water-types and most Electric-types. Grass-types can also be safe to switch into in order to set up Stealth Rock or Spikes. Ferroseed should always try and use Leech Seed in order to stay healthy, and if it runs it, it should use Thunder Wave on obvious switch-ins. Opposing Pokemon can be whittled down if they lack a setup move, as the combination of Leech Seed and Bullet Seed will quickly bring any non-Grass-type to low health.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Spritzee is single-handedly the best partner for Ferroseed. Spritzee helps keep Ferroseed alive with Wish support and can switch in on common Fighting-types and immediately threaten them with Moonblast. If Ferroseed is running Thunder Wave, slow Pokemon make great partners. Honedge is excellent as Thunder Wave mitigates its low Speed, letting it run Shadow Claw instead of the weaker Shadow Sneak. Pokemon that can take Fire-type attacks make excellent partners for Ferroseed as well. Chinchou is great because it can repeatedly pivot in and out and appreciates Leech Seed recovery. Houndour and Ponyta are excellent as well, as they absorb Fire-type hits and immediately threaten with a strong attack of their own. Partners resistant to Fighting-type attacks are desirable as well. Trubbish makes a great partner, as it resists Fighting-type attacks, absorbs Knock Offs, and can even be a second entry hazard setter on a more stall-based team. Common revenge killers such as Fletchling make great partners, as Ferroseed tends to lure in setup sweepers like Scraggy. Pawniard is another great partner, as it can deter the opponent from using Defog, which can undo all of Ferroseed's hard work.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Iron Head can be used over Bullet Seed for a more reliable check to Fairy-types, but it is generally weak, and Bullet Seed is more useful because it deals with Tirtouga and other Sturdy Pokemon. Seed Bomb can be a more reliable Grass-type STAB, but again, Bullet Seed is more desirable because it breaks Sturdy. Toxic can be used in the last slot as it allows Ferroseed to deal passive damage along with Leech Seed. It is also useful for any switch-ins that use Substitute, allowing Ferroseed to catch them on the switch and dealing heavy damage over time.</p>

<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Timburr can all come in with little fear and threaten Ferroseed with their Fighting-type STAB attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Houndour, Ponyta, and Larvesta work in the same way Fighting-types do, having relatively free switch-ins while being able to threaten Ferroseed.</p>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While Grass-types do not actually threaten Ferroseed, Ferroseed also fails to threaten them. Depending on their set, these free turns could be a struggle for both players.</p>

<p><strong>Defog and Rapid Spin</strong>: Pokemon such as Drilbur and Vullaby do not actually beat Ferroseed, but remove the entry hazards Ferroseed has put up.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon that might run Taunt, such as Mienfoo, can give Ferroseed trouble, as Taunt prevents Ferroseed from setting entry hazards or using Thunder Wave.</p>

<p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard fears nothing Ferroseed has and can easily use Ferroseed as setup fodder. It does not even fear Thunder Wave that much due to Sucker Punch.</p>

<p><strong>Scraggy</strong>: Scraggy can switch in and set up, often not fearing Thunder Wave due to Shed Skin. Scraggy can immediately threaten with Drain Punch or can Knock Off as well.</p>

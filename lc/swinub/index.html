<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Swinub is a niche Stealth Rock setter thanks to its ability to almost always guarantee their set up. Its ability, Oblivious, makes it immune to Taunt, meaning the only time it might not set up Stealth Rock is when multi-hit move and Fake Out users are on the field. Swinub has a priority move in Ice Shard, helps compensate for Swinub's mediocre Speed. Although Swinub has a good offensive typing, it also has bad bulk and a poor defensive typing. </p>

<h1>Stealth Rock</h1>

<div class=set>
    Swinub @ Focus Sash<br>
    Ability: Oblivious<br>
    EVs: 116 HP / 196 Atk / 196 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Stealth Rock<br>- Ice Shard<br>- Earthquake<br>- Endeavor
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Stealth Rock breaks enemies' Sturdy and Focus Sashes, which helps sweepers. Ice Shard is a good priority move to use when Endeavor is not appropriate. Earthquake is Swinub's strongest STAB move and can be used if Swinub has not yet had its Sash broken. Endeavor is used when Swinub is down to 1 HP and it outspeeds its opponent. </p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EV spread and nature maximize Swinub's Speed and Attack. Oblivious prevents Swinub's from being Taunted, and therefore not being able to set up Stealth Rock. Focus Sash ensures that Stealth Rock will be set unless the foe has Fake Out or a multi-hit move.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>When Swinub has only 1 HP left, use Endeavor if it is faster than its opponent. Use Ice Shard otherwise. After setting up Stealth Rock, Earthquake should be utilized in most situations, as it is Swinub's strongest attack. Swinub is a lead with Stealth Rock and should be setting it up as soon as possible. If the opposing Pokemon has Fake Out or a multi-hit move, such as Aipom or Dwebble, do not try and set up Stealth Rock, as Swinub's sash will be broken.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Swinub works well with a spinblocker such as Pumpkaboo. Pawniard appreciates being Defogged and discourages the use of Defog thanks to its ability, Defiant. Setup sweepers such as Scraggy or Tirtouga appreciate Stealth Rock's ability to break Sturdy and Focus Sashes.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Freeze-Dry is a somewhat viable option for Swinub but is generally outclassed by its physical counterparts. Swinub can effectively run a Choice Scarf set but is still slower than most other Choice Scarf users. Life Orb can be used, but Swinub is so dreadfully slow that it is hard to utilize. Icicle Spear and Icicle Crash can be used as alternatives to Ice Shard.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Swinub has mediocre Attack and can provide a free setup turn to some sweepers such as Scraggy, Tirtouga, and Timburr.</p>

<p><strong>Spinners and Defoggers</strong>: Most Rapid Spinners and Defoggers, including Vullaby and Drilbur, can remove Stealth Rock and beat Swinub.</p>

<p><strong>Fake Out and Multi-Hit Move Users</strong>: Fake Out and multi-hit move users, such as Dwebble, Aipom, and Mienfoo, can break Swinub's Focus Sash and prevent it from using Stealth Rock.</p>

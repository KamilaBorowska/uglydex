<h1>Tiers</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href='/uglydex/lc/riolu'>LC</a>
</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<ul>
<li>Mostly outclassed by other Fighting-types</li>
<li>Prankster Copycat sets it apart, allowing it to hit twice in a row most of the time, as well as revenge killing random threats.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Prankster</h1>

<div class=set>
    Riolu @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Prankster<br>
    EVs: 196 HP / 196 Def / 116 SpD<br>
    Impish Nature<br>
    - Copycat<br>- Protect<br>- Drain Punch<br>- Toxic / Crunch
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<ul>
<li>Prankster Copycat allows it to copy the last used move with priority. This means it can usually hit Drain Punch twice, or revenge Pokemon such as Scraggy or Dwebble.</li>
<li>It can also be used to copycat things such as U-turn or Volt Switch from a teammate to keep up momentum, or set up things such as the opposing teams hazards or boosting moves.</li>
<li>Protect works amazingly well with Prankster as it allows it to protect itself from, and then use certain moves such as Foongus's Spore.
-Drain Punch is the main STAB move, providing decent recovery, especially when Copycat allows it to use it twice in a row.</li>
<li>Toxic is great, and can be used, with priority, to wear down bulky foes.</li>
<li>Crunch is the best option against Ghost-type switch ins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<ul>
<li>Eviolite is the preferred item as it maximizes Riolu's bulk.</li>
<li>EVs are heavily invested in Physical Defense, which allows it to take on Physical attackers, such as Scraggy, with ease.</li>
<li>The rest is put into Special Defense to give it some Special Bulk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Riolu should be used as a pivot, switching into the Dark-, Rock-, Steel- and Normal-types it walls. </li>
<li>Often Copycat has very situational uses, so make sure you think about the plays you can make with it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>VoltTurn users such as Chinchou can often be used to get Riolu in safely, and then Riolu can copycat their Volt Switch or U-Turn to preserve momentum.</li>
<li>Riolu needs something that can take on Poison-, Psychic-, Fairy-, or Flying-types. Cottonee and Fletchling are especially problematic as they can use faster priority.</li>
<li>Chinchou helps with taking on Flying-types. </li>
<li>Pawniard can switch into Cottonee, as well as Psychic-types moves.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<ul>
<li>Riolu can boost its stats with Swords Dance, Agility or Bulk Up, but its boosting sets are generally outclassed by other Pokemon.</li>
<li>High Jump Kick is an option for a powerful STAB move and with Copycat, it can use it twice in a row to deal quite a lot of damage.</li>
<li>Iron Tail is its best option against Spritzee, but its low accuracy is off-putting. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>With base 100 Attack, Trapinch has the 4th highest Attack stat on Little Cup, capping off at 20 with a positive nature. It also has the ability Arena Trap, allowing it to trap grounded Pokemon that can give your team trouble. This, along with its great coverage with Earthquake and Rock Slide alone, makes it a very threatening trapper. It also has Quick Attack, which enables it to break Focus Sash and Sturdy. Sadly, this is where the good things end for Trapinch, as its major downside is that it's not very good outside of Trick Room teams. Also, its bulk is average, so it doesn't take hits very well. </p>

<h1>Trick Room Trapper</h1>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Earthquake is the STAB move of choice used to deal some solid damage. Rock Slide offers good coverage, hitting Flying-type Pokemon switching in after something Trapinch has trapped gets taken down. Crunch is used to deal super effective damage to Bronzor and Baltoy, and also to OHKO Gastly. Quick Attack is used to break through Focus Sash and Sturdy, or simply to get one last hit after Trick Room ends.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The spread's purpose is to simply maximize Attack, putting Trapinch at 20 Attack. The rest of the EVs are for more bulk in general. 0 Speed IVs are required so that Trapinch outspeeds as many things as possible while Trick Room is active. 0 HP IVs are necessary if Trapinch is using Life Orb to reduce the amount of recoil it receives from it.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Trapinch's purpose for the team is mostly to dispose of the most threatening grounded Pokemon on the opposing team by trapping them and knocking them out. As such, you should pay attention during Team Preview to decide what you want Trapinch to trap. Examples of good Pokemon Trapinch can trap and beat while under Trick Room include, but are not limited to, Pawniard, Magnemite, Croagunk, Trubbish, Cranidos, Onix, Elekid, and Fire-types (beware of Will-O-Wisp, though). In addition to its trapping supportive role, Trapinch can also be a reliable sweeper because of its high Attack stat and great coverage.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Trapinch works well with Trick Room setters that are weak to grounded Pokemon that don't beat it. Porygon is weak to Croagunk, which Trapinch can take down. Spritzee is weak to Poison-types such as Trubbish and Steel-types such as Magnemite, Pawniard, Shieldon, and Aron, which Trapinch can also dispose off. Corphish and Cranidos are both great teammates for Trapinch, as Trapinch can get rid of Croagunk, which is a major nuisance for both of them. Mienfoo and Scraggy appreciate Poison-types being gone, mainly Trubbish, which makes them good partners as well.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>You can use Superpower instead of Crunch to hit some bulky Normal-types really hard before switching out, but the option's highly outclassed as Trapinch misses out on hitting Ghost-types and the set is walled by Baltoy. Also, the stat drops are going to force Trapinch to switch out, making you highly predictable.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Koffing</strong>: Koffing is immune to Earthquake and is neutral to Rock Slide and Crunch and resists Superpower. Koffing also burns Trapinch, crippling it.</p>

<p><strong>Aqua Jet Users</strong>: Aqua Jet users can hit Trapinch first while under Trick Room. However, Life Orb Trapinch is only OHKOed by Corphish's Aqua Jet; the rest of the Aqua Jet users will need Trapinch to be worn down before they can revenge kill it.</p>

<p><strong>Slowpoke</strong>: Slowpoke can come in on Trapinch and use Scald, not having to worry about Crunch, as it isn't 2HKOed unless Trapinch has Life Orb, in which case, Trapinch will be KOed by Scald + Life Orb recoil instead.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Chespin, Lileep, and Foongus are bulky enough to take all of Trapinch's attacks, and the latter two are able to recover their health back with Giga Drain.</p>

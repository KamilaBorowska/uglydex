<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Amaura is an excellent answer to Flying-types in the Little Cup metagame, resisting their STAB Flying-type attacks and hitting back with its two super effective STAB options. Amaura's unique ability Refrigerate turns all Normal-type moves into Ice-type moves and boosts them by 1.3x, which is practically a Life Orb boost with no recoil. Its other ability, Snow Warning, is unreleased. A Rock / Ice typing is awesome offensively but horrible defensively; it has a ton of weaknesses, including a 4x weakness to Steel and Fighting, which is certainly not good in a tier housing strong Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Scraggy. Moreover, common priority attacks such as Mach Punch or Aqua Jet really dampen Amaura's impact on the metagame.</p>

    - Nature Power<br>- Ancient Power<br>- Thunderbolt / Hidden Power Fighting<br>- Hyper Beam / Dark Pulse / Thunder Wave
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Nature Power, the main attack, turns into Tri Attack this generation. It is especially unique on Amaura because of Refrigerate, making Nature Power an Ice-type move. This is Amaura's main attacking option, and is the preferred option due to the bonus 20% chance to inflict a status effect. Ancient Power is the secondary STAB move, as it has awesome coverage alongside Nature Power, particularly against Fire-types. Ancient Power gives Amaura a second option to hit Flying-types super effectively. Thunderbolt is used to nail the Water-types that resist Nature Power and also provide a third super effective attack against Flying-types. Dark Pulse can be used to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gastly and Gothita for super effective damage. Hyper Beam is an extreme option that adds up to be a 292 Base Power Ice-type attack which obliterates almost any important threat late-game after Amaura has already put in work; it is dangerous but can be worth it when you need to take down an important threat quickly. Hidden Power Fighting can be used in the third or fourth slot if Pawniard is an issue, as Pawniard is lured in and OHKOed by it, but if you don't predict the switch, this issue won't come up often, making it more of a situational move than anything. Thunder Wave can also be used in the third or fourth slot, as this allows Amaura to permanently cripple a threat such as Mienfoo, or even to pressure the opposing team; however, it is unwise to be locked into Thunder Wave.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>With the given Speed investment and a Choice Scarf, Amaura hits 21 Speed, enough to outspeed everything in the game under normal conditions. A Modest nature is recommended here to make Amaura the most potent specially offensive threat possible, and Amaura still has all the Speed it needs. Amaura has naturally high HP and thus has less of a need to invest there, however, 60 HP EVs allow it to hit 25 HP, so it can switch into Stealth Rock five times instead of four.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Amaura isn't frail, but it doesn't have Eviolite and has a lot of weaknesses, so it must be played with utmost care and cannot take super effective hits. Amaura is weak to many common priority moves, including Aqua Jet, Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave. Never switch Amaura in unless you are very sure it will be coming in on a resisted attack; Amaura really shines against Flying-types but is also resistant to Normal-, Poison-, and Ice-type moves. Amaura deals little damage to Steel-types and should have teammates that can deal with these. Amaura's STAB moves are incredible offensively and often OHKO top-tier threats such as Drilbur and Fletchling; its STAB moves also obliterate anti-meta threats such as Growlithe, Vullaby, Natu, and Archen. Hyper Beam is the panic button; use it only if you absolutely need it. Even if Amaura can't KO the active enemy with any of its other moves, don't use it if Amaura may be needed later in the game. It is acceptable to use Hyper Beam against something like a setup sweeper to OHKO it without worrying about your regular attacks not doing enough damage, however. Some setup sweepers such as Omanyte or Zigzagoon can set up on Amaura after Hyper Beam is used, so if dangerous sweepers are on the opposing team be very cautious of using it at the wrong time.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>A physically defensive Slowpoke is the best partner Amaura can possibly have, as it soaks up all the priority attacks that Amaura is weak to and also walls the two types that Amaura is 4x weak against. Larvesta is a great partner for Amaura, as Larvesta can switch into common threats such as Pawniard or Mienfoo and slowly weaken them. Drilbur is a great partner as well, as Amaura can OHKO Foongus and Cottonee, while Drilbur can provide entry hazard support as well as spin away opposing hazards. Honedge cushions Amaura's weak points comfortably and can take advantage by setting up with Swords Dance or Autotomize after switching in, though it does share a Ground-type weakness with Amaura. However, Amaura can deal with Ground-types rather easily with its Ice-type STAB moves so it shouldn't have to switch out of those. Pawniard is a huge problem for Amaura both offensively and defensively, so any bulky Fighting-type, preferably one with a priority Fighting-type attack, can be a great teammate. These include Impish Eviolite Mienfoo, special Croagunk, and Timburr. Any teammate that can remove hazards is greatly appreciated by Amaura and helps with its longevity.</p>

<h1>Berry Juice Pivot</h1>

    Ability: Refrigerate<br>
    EVs: 60 HP / 200 Def / 224 SpA / 16 SpD<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Nature Power<br>- Thunder Wave<br>- Ancient Power<br>- Hidden Power Fighting / Hyper Beam
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Nature Power is the main STAB move, dealing solid damage to any Pokemon that does not resist Ice-type attacks and still dealing a solid hit to some that do resist it. Thunder Wave is a great support option for Amaura, as Amaura is naturally slow and lures in faster Pokemon such as Mienfoo or Pawniard. It is great for pivoting in and out of battle and gaining momentum. Ancient Power is a great move to OHKO Pokemon such as Larvesta; it also gives Amaura an option against Fire-type Pokemon such as Ponyta and Vulpix. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to OHKO Pawniard, although Iron Head must be watched out for. Hyper Beam can be a great nuke, especially late-game when the opponent has no switch-in. Hyper Beam should go in the last slot if Thunder Wave is the preferred option for dealing with Pawniard.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Berry Juice allows Amaura to reliably check Pokemon such as Fletchling, and can heal Amaura back to full health over one turn. A Modest nature with 224 Special Attack EVs allow Amaura to hit as hard as possible. The rest of the EVs are distributed towards its defenses and allow Amaura to take some hits. 60 HP EVs allow Amaura to hit 25 HP, allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock one more time than it normally would be able to.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Amaura should normally be brought in on Pokemon such as Fletchling. In a pinch, Amaura can check non-Hidden Power Fighting variants of Gastly and Abra, although this should not be risked unless you are absolutely sure that they do not carry Hidden Power Fighting. Amaura lures in Pokemon such as Mienfoo, which you can Thunder Wave and cripple for the rest of a match, and it can even pull some crazy baits to gain momentum. Hyper Beam is an attack that should only be used to guarantee a KO on an important Pokemon, such as the opposing team's win condition. If your opponent has a dangerous one-turn setup sweeper such as Zigzagoon, Hyper Beam should never be used as it will grant a free turn that could very well end the game.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Slowpoke is the best partner Amaura can possibly have, as it soaks up all the priority attacks that Amaura is weak to, and also walls the two types that Amaura is 4x weak against. Larvesta is another great partner for Amaura, as Larvesta can switch into top tier threats such as Pawniard or Mienfoo, while also slowly weakening the opponent's team with U-turn and Will-O-Wisp. Drilbur is a great partner as well, as Amaura can OHKO Foongus and Cottonee, while Drilbur provides hazard support as well as being able to spin away opposing hazards. Honedge has excellent type synergy with Amaura and can take advantage of common switch-ins by setting up with Swords Dance or Autotomize, though it does share a Ground weakness with Amaura. Pawniard is a huge problem for Amaura both offensively and defensively so any bulky Fighting-type can be a good teammate. Pokemon that do well include bulky Mienfoo sets, Croagunk, and Timburr. Any teammate that can remove hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, is greatly appreciated by Amaura and helps with its longevity.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Rock Polish can work well but most Steel-types will either OHKO Amaura or force it out, so Thunder Wave is generally a better option for a lasting Speed advantage over opponents. Various type berries can be used to replace Berry Juice in the pivot set, as this allows Amaura to lure and KO various Pokemon. A Rindo Berry Rock Polish set can be used as a soft check to Bellsprout and sun offense teams. If a Rindo Berry is used as an anti-sun team Pokemon, then a spread of 60 HP / 36 Def / 224 SpA / 92 SpD / 68 Spe with a Careful nature should be used. This allows Amaura to always live a Life Orb Bellsprout Solarbeam, while still OHKOing with Nature Power. The leftover EVs are put into Speed and Defense, to raise both to 12. 12 Speed allows Amaura to outspeed and cripple Tirtouga with Thunder Wave or outspeed it at +2 when Tirtouga is boosted as well. A Chople Berry can be held to lure in Pokemon such as Timburr or Mienfoo and try and KO them, while also living hits such as Timburr's Mach Punch or Croagunk's Vaccuum Wave. Amaura has access to tons of support moves, including dual screens, Calm Mind, Encore, Haze, Psych Up, and Safeguard, but it doesn't have the typing to be able to effectively use any of these in most situations. Amaura can go physical with a set that includes Return, Rock Slide, and Bulldoze, but its special offensive set is more reliable and generally better to use in the tier. Mirror Coat is kind of gimmicky but Amaura does have access to it.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pawniard, Bronzor, Ferroseed, Honedge, and even Aron all trouble Amaura, easily OHKOing it. Amaura's STAB moves are walled by these Pokemon, so it can't do much to them.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Timburr, special Croagunk, Mienfoo, and Scraggy can quite easily check Amaura with the threat of an OHKO with their Fighting-type STAB moves. Bulkier Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr can directly switch into anything Amaura has to offer and OHKO with Drain Punch and Mach Punch, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Chinchou and Slowpoke can easily take on Amaura, especially if Amaura doesn't run Thunderbolt. They can usually switch into a Nature Power or Hyper Beam and OHKO or severely dent with Scald or Hydro Pump.</p>

<p><strong>Munchlax</strong>: Munchlax with Thick Fat and Earthquake can get around Amaura quite easily, as it resists Amaura's Ice-type STAB attacks while ignoring most other attacks due to its inherent bulk. Similarly, Porygon is a great check, although it can be 3HKOed by Nature Power, so a bad status effect or an ill-timed full paralysis can spell doom for Porygon.</p>

<p><strong>Priority attacks</strong>: Common priority attacks such as Mach Punch, Vaccuum Wave, and Aqua Jet all hit hard, and bypass Amaura's Choice Scarf set.</p>

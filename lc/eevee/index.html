<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The only reason to use Eevee over Bunnelby is its overall better bulk, which allows it to survive Fletchling's Acrobatics even after Stealth Rock damage. However, aside from this, Bunnelby completely outclasses Eevee, as it is much stronger and packs better coverage options. Eevee's movepool is fairly unique and allows for various creative sets, but its options are either useless or outclassed.</p>

<h1>Physical Attacker</h1>

<div class=set>
    Eevee @ Choice Band / Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Adaptability<br>
    EVs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe<br>
    Jolly / Adamant Nature<br>
    - Return / Double-Edge<br>- Quick Attack<br>- Bite<br>- Iron Tail
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Thanks to Adaptability, Return is a very powerful STAB move, hitting foes that do not resist it for massive damage. Double-Edge can be used for even more power at the cost of recoil, which can wear Eevee down quickly, especially if Life Orb is being used. Quick Attack, also boosted by Adaptability, is a strong priority move that can pick off weakened threats. Bite allows Eevee to hit Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo for super effective damage. Iron Tail can be used to hit Rock-types such as Archen and Lileep hard.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>236 Attack and Speed EVs are used to maximize Eevee's offensive capabilities, with 36 EVs going into Defense to increase it by one point and let Eevee take on priority attacks easier. A Jolly nature is preferred, as the difference in power between Adamant and Jolly is minimal, but Eevee will be able to outspeed threats such as Adamant Bunnelby, Jolly Scraggy, and Adamant Cranidos, while Speed tying with other 16 Speed users such as Chinchou, Jolly Bunnelby, and Dwebble. Choice Band provides great power, especially combined with Adaptability, but locks Eevee into one move. Life Orb allows Eevee to switch between moves, but doesn't boost its power as much as Choice Band does and wears Eevee down with recoil.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Return or Double-Edge should be used most of the time, as they have incredible damage output potential. Bite and Quick Attack should only be used for Ghost-types and weakened threats, respectively. Iron Tail can hit predicted Rock-type switch-ins. Be careful of locking Eevee into a Normal-type move when the opponent still has a Ghost-type alive.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Something to deal with Fighting-types is recommended, such as Spritzee, Snubbull, or Croagunk. Gothita is a great teammate that can trap and KO Ferroseed, Archen, Tirtouga, and Fighting-types, making it easier for Eevee to sweep. Pursuit trappers such as Pawniard and Stunky are strongly recommended to deal with Ghost-types.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Hidden Power Fighting can be used because it OHKOes non-Eviolite Pawniard. Eevee can use a Wish + Baton Pass set to heal teammates with Wish, but Lickitung and Spritzee are generally better at this. Last Resort is extremely powerful but requires Eevee to use all of its other moves beforehand. Heal Bell is a decent filler move that allows Eevee to heal its team of status. Curse is a decent setup move, but Eevee will rarely find opportunities to use it. Yawn can be used to cripple or force out predicted switches. Body Slam can be used on a more supportive set.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Pancham can deal massive damage if they can switch in safely.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to Eevee's Adaptability-boosted Normal-type STAB moves, and bulkier Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo don't mind a Bite or two.</p>

<p><strong>Steel- and Rock-types</strong>: Steel- and Rock-types such as Pawniard and Archen can easily switch into Eevee's STAB moves, and Swords Dance Pawniard can use Eevee as setup bait. However, Rock-type Pokemon need to watch out for Iron Tail.</p>

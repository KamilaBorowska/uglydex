<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Yamask's Ghost typing and excellent Defense make it a great stop to Normal- and Fighting-types, and Mummy lets it nullify the useful abilities of contact attackers. Its wide movepool allows it to support its team in many ways, such as with Will-O-Wisp and Memento or through Trick Room, which works well with its terrible Speed. However, without Trick Room, Yamask's low Speed hampers its capacity for support. It is also weak to Knock Off, and its low HP and lack of reliable recovery leave it prone to being worn down.</p>

<h1>Support</h1>

<div class=set>
    Yamask @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Mummy<br>
    EVs: 52 HP / 236 Def / 156 SpD / 36 Spe<br>
    Calm / Careful Nature<br>
    - Memento<br>- Will-O-Wisp<br>- Shadow Ball / Hex / Knock Off<br>- Pain Split
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Memento allows Yamask to sacrifice itself and let a teammate set up more easily by lowering the foe's offenses. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and is easily spread throughout the opposing team thanks to Yamask's good bulk. For a STAB move, Shadow Ball is reliable and decently powerful, whereas Hex synergizes well with Will-O-Wisp but is weak when the target is not statused. Knock Off can also be used to support the team by removing opposing Pokemon's Eviolite, Life Orb, or Choice Scarf; however, using Knock Off means Yamask will become very passive, as it won't have any powerful moves. Finally, Pain Split works well with Yamask's low HP stat, healing it somewhat reliably while damaging the foe.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Mummy cripples Pokemon that rely on their ability and make contact, such as Mienfoo. Eviolite is chosen over Berry Juice to give Yamask even more bulk and to let it take Knock Off better. Maximum Defense investment is used to capitalize on Yamask's solid Defense stat, while 76 Special Defense EVs and a Calm or Careful nature hit an Eviolite number to give Yamask maximum bulk; use a Careful nature when using Knock Off and a Calm one when not. The remaining EVs boost Yamask's HP and Speed by one point each.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Spread burns throughout the opposing team to cushion the blows of physical attackers and wear down walls. Remember that you can't burn Fire-types and that you will give some, such as Houndour, a potentially lethal Flash Fire boost by using Will-O-Wisp on the switch; in these situations, predict the opponent's switch to the Flash Fire user and either double switch to an appropriate counter or use a different move. Yamask should switch into physical attackers that don't carry Knock Off and proceed to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp and Mummy, as it can easily wall them; keep it away from Pokemon such as Pawniard that can Knock Off its Eviolite, though. Don't switch Yamask into special or mixed attackers, which prey on its weaker Special Defense, can usually outspeed it, and aren't crippled too much by Will-O-Wisp. Memento should be used mid- or late-game when Yamask is no longer needed to let a partner switch in and set up on the weakened foe. Keep in mind, however, that it can only be used once and that it sacrifices Yamask, so there must be a Pokemon on your team that can take advantage of it.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Partners such as Lickitung, Pawniard, and Tirtouga appreciate Yamask's immunity to Fighting-type attacks, which they are weak to. Lickitung provides Wish support and is a specially bulky Pokemon to fall back on if a special attacker proves troublesome for Yamask; Pawniard handles threatening Ghost-types such as Gastly with Knock Off; and Tirtouga can set up on a foe crippled by Yamask's Memento, Will-O-Wisp, and Mummy. Other Wish users, such as Spritzee, Knock Off users, such as Vullaby, and specially defensive Pokemon, such as Munchlax, can be good partners as well. Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off, such as Mienfoo and Trubbish, make for good partners. Mienfoo can also take on Dark-types for Yamask, while Trubbish provides Spikes and Toxic Spikes support, which synergizes well with Hex but can interfere with Yamask's burn spreading. Finally, entry hazard removers such as Archen and Staryu, in addition to Heal Bell or Aromatherapy users such as Chinchou, can help keep Yamask from being worn down.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Trick + Choice Specs can be used to heavily cripple physical attackers and let Yamask fire off more powerful attacks. To patch up its low Speed, Yamask can use an offensive Trick Room set consisting of Trick Room / Nasty Plot / Shadow Ball / Energy Ball. Hidden Power Fighting gives Yamask unresisted coverage in tandem with a STAB move and deals decent damage to many of its checks, including Pawniard and Scraggy. Magic Coat allows Yamask to bounce back entry hazards and Toxic Spikes lets it set them, but it doesn't have spare moveslots for these moves.</p>

<p>Destiny Bond lets Yamask remove a single threat, and Haze allows it to neuter setup sweepers; however, it's much too slow to make use of these moves, and every setup sweeper either beats Yamask regardless or is crippled more effectively by Will-O-Wisp than by Haze. Disable can be used after a predicted Knock Off from a Fighting-type such as Mienfoo so that it can't touch Yamask afterwards, but Yamask will take heavy damage and lose its Eviolite in the process. Calm Mind looks good on paper for its ability to boost both Yamask's mediocre Special Defense and its average Special Attack, but Yamask is much too slow to function as a setup sweeper, and its weaknesses to Shadow Sneak, Sucker Punch, and Knock Off only exacerbate this fact. Yamask can use Energy Ball and Psychic to hit Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types and Fighting- and Poison-types, respectively, but it doesn't have the moveslots or power to use these moves effectively.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard, Scraggy, Vullaby, and Stunky are great counters to Yamask because of its Ghost typing, low Speed, and inability to do anything back. Pawniard, Vullaby, and Scraggy can 2HKO Yamask with Knock Off if they aren't burnt, while Stunky can Pursuit trap it. Additionally, Pawniard gains an Attack boost from Memento thanks to Defiant, Scraggy can rid itself of Will-O-Wisp burns with Shed Skin, and Vullaby can Roost off any damage from Yamask's attacks. However, these Dark-types have to be wary of Will-O-Wisp on the switch.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt from the likes of Mienfoo completely shuts Yamask down, preventing it from supporting its team and forcing it to either resort to its weak attacks or switch out, giving the opponent momentum. Almost all Taunt users are also faster than Yamask due to its low Speed, but they can be played around by switching to a teammate that isn't crippled as much by Taunt.</p>

<p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Yamask is weak to Knock Off, and strong users of the move such as Pawniard and Vullaby can remove its Eviolite and deal heavy damage to it in one fell swoop. Trick or Switcheroo users such as Buneary and Gothita can neuter Yamask by giving it a Choice item while taking its Eviolite.</p>

<p><strong>Defiant Users</strong>: Pawniard and the rarer Mankey can take advantage of Yamask's Memento, gaining a huge Attack boost from it. Pawniard in particular is a huge threat to Yamask, as it has access to priority Sucker Punch, STAB Knock Off, and Swords Dance. Competitive users can also take advantage of Memento in this way, but there are no viable ones in LC.</p>

<p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Will-O-Wisp from Ponyta and Larvesta, Stealth Rock from Ferroseed and Drilbur, and chip damage from various attacks can quickly wear Yamask down due to its lack of reliable recovery; however, a Wish user can help mitigate this issue.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While Gastly can't switch in because of its inability to OHKO Yamask, it can still deal irreparable damage to Yamask with Shadow Ball and isn't crippled too much by Will-O-Wisp or Pain Split due to its being a special attacker and having low HP. Pumpkaboo is able to take a weakened Yamask down with priority Shadow Sneak, but it has to be wary of Shadow Ball, Will-O-Wisp, and Pain Split.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers that can take a hit from Yamask, such as Chinchou and Spritzee, can switch in and dent Yamask by hitting its weaker Special Defense. Chinchou can cure its team of Will-O-Wisp burns using Heal Bell and pivot out of its switch-in with Volt Switch, while Spritzee can do the same with Aromatherapy and heal off the damage dealt using Wish.</p>

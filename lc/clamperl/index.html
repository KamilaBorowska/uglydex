<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Clamperl is a unique Pokemon thanks to its signature item, DeepSeaTooth, which allows it to reach a shattering 34 Special Attack. On top of this, Clamperl has access to Shell Smash, which patches up its poor Speed and skyrockets its Special Attack stat. However, Clamperl's Speed stat is quite poor even when boosted, and Clamperl finds it hard to find an opportunity to set up in the first place. While Shell Smash provides Clamperl with immense offensive boosts, it comes with the negative side effect of lowering Clamperl's defenses, thus making it very vulnerable to priority. Clamperl faces stiff competition from Omanyte as a Shell Smash sweeper because Omanyte is less item-reliant, has a superior typing, and is also bulkier than Clamperl; however, Clamperl hits harder than Omanyte.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Shell Smash is a seldom distributed move that instantly boosts Clamperl's Attack, Speed, and Special Attack stats by two stages each; these boosts, allow Clamperl to outspeed a large portion of the metagame and hit the majority of it extremely hard. Surf is Clamperl's strongest STAB option and is quite reliable, so it is often the most spammable move. Ice Beam nets nice coverage against Pokemon that resist Surf, such as Foongus, Croagunk, and Cottonee. Substitute lets Clamperl set up with more ease and allows it to avoid Sucker Punch from the likes of Pawniard; it also blocks Thunder Wave and other status-inflicting moves.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EVs are allocated into Special Attack and Speed for the highest sweeping potential; the Special Defense EVs give Clamperl one extra point in Special Defense. A Modest nature provides four extra Special Attack points when boosted, thus making it the preferred option over a Timid nature. Shell Armor is especially useful in Clamperl's case because it prevents critical hits from ruining its sweep; this is most often a problem when coming from priority. DeepSeaTooth is Clamperl's signature item which doubles its Special Attack, making it even harder to switch into. It is important to note that no item, not even Eviolite, should ever be run over DeepSeaTooth, as nothing provides equal or more benefits as it does.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Clamperl can be used at various times throughout the match; during early-game, it can fire powerful attacks to weaken threats for later in the game, while Clamperl can set up and pull off a sweep late-game. Clamperl should never set up recklessly, as it will almost always get only one opportunity to do so; for example, Clamperl could set up a Shell Smash when it is facing a potential Choice Scarf user, which could outspeed it even after a boost and thus waste Clamperl. Another example of this is setting up too early when bulkier walls can still stomach its hits and force it out. Finally, Clamperl should never set up until strong priority users, such as Pawniard and Fletchling, are KOed, as priority moves bypass Clamperl's Speed boosts.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Clamperl requires a lot of team support to be able to sweep. Cottonee is able to support Clamperl by gaining momentum with Encore and easing setup with Memento; it also resists both of Clamperl's weaknesses and can take on Chinchou quite easily. Entry hazard support is crucial to wear down bulkier Pokemon so Clamperl can break through them; such support can come from Dwebble, Drilbur, and Archen. Foongus has good defensive synergy with Clamperl and can use Spore to pivot into Clamperl for an easier time setting up. Wynaut stands out as well for its ability to trap Choice Scarf users and KO them before they have a chance to revenge kill Clamperl. Entry hazard removal from Drilbur is appreciated, as Clamperl doesn't enjoy being worn down, because if it is worn down, it cannot survive priority attacks. Diglett can set Stealth Rock, trap Pawniard, and provide Memento support, making it a prime partner to Clamperl.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Clamperl really doesn't have many options other than the listed moves, as it has quite a tiny movepool. Hidden Power Electric hits Tentacool and Mantyke hard, but neither are common enough to make running it worth Clamperl's time. Running Rattled is a possibility, but Shell Armor is much more useful in nearly all cases. A defensively oriented set with DeepSeaScale might sound viable on paper, but Clamperl lacks recovery moves and is better at fulfilling other roles, making it an unwise choice.</p>

<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: Fletchling is the strongest priority user in the metagame and has an easy time KOing Clamperl after it uses Shell Smash, while Pawniard can KO Clamperl with Sucker Punch after a bit of prior damage. Fighting-types with access to priority, such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk, are also able to check Clamperl.</p>

<p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users, such as Gastly and Doduo, are able to outspeed and KO Clamperl. Focus Sash Abra is another great revenge killer that always KOes Clamperl with Psychic after Shell Smash's Special Defense drop. Pokemon that take advantage of SturdyJuice, such as Magnemite and Tirtouga, can take a hit from Clamperl and KO it in return.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Not many bulky Pokemon bar Ferroseed and Munchlax care to switch into Clamperl, but most others are able to stomach a hit or two and either force it out or cripple it through various means, such as with status or phazing moves. </p>

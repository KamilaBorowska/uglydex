<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Gyarados boasts a great Attack stat, which allows it to plow through physical walls after setting up. It also has nice coverage options with moves such as Earthquake. Furthermore, Intimidate is useful against opposing physical attackers, as it lowers their Attack stat. However, Gyarados does have its downsides; it is 4x weak to Electric-type attacks, and is also hampered immensely by status such as paralysis and burn.</p>

<h1>Dragon Dance</h1>

<div class=set>
    Gyarados @ Gyaradosite / Wacan Berry<br>
    Ability: Intimidate<br>
    EVs: 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Waterfall<br>- Earthquake<br>- Dragon Dance / Taunt<br>- Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Waterfall is Gyarados's main STAB move, and it has a nice chance to flinch opposing Pokemon. Earthquake provides spread damage and is really spiffy after Gyarados has Mega Evolved and gained Mold Breaker, as it allows Gyarados to OHKO Rotom-W. Taunt allows Gyarados a ton of little options. You can Taunt Aromatisse through Aroma Veil, for example. Dragon Dance boosts Gyarados's Attack and Speed and puts a lot of pressure on your opponent to beat Gyarados as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EV spread gives Gyarados enough Speed to outrun minimum Speed Rotom-W and maximum Attack, with the rest put into HP. A Speed creep is highly recommended however as most Rotom-A Speed creep. Gyaradosite is the item of choice so Gyarados can Mega Evolve which allows it to take on Rotom-W. Wacan Berry allows Gyarados to take a Thunderbolt from Rotom-W better.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Make sure to Mega Evolve conservatively. Switch in and out liberally for as many Intimidate drops as possible before you Mega Evolve Gyarados. Never stay in on an Electric-type unless Gyarados's Wacan Berry is still intact, if you decide to run that.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Gyarados pairs up well with Pokemon that appreciate the Fighting- and Water-type resistances and Earthquake immunity it brings, such as Tyranitar. Pokemon that resist or are immune to Electric and Rock, such as Garchomp, are especially good partners. Rotom-H can take Electric-type hits and KO Amoonguss with Overheat, and therefore it is a good teammate. Amoonguss shuts down Rotom-W for Gyarados and provides a cushion for Gyarados to set up Dragon Dance under. Talonflame beats up the Grass-types Gyarados might have trouble with and is still immune to Earthquake after Gyarados Mega Evolves.</p>

<h1>Bulky</h1>

<div class=set>
    Gyarados @ Sitrus Berry / Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Intimidate<br>
    EVs: 100 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Def / 4 SpD / 68 Spe<br>
    Adamant / Jolly Nature<br>
    - Waterfall<br>- Thunder Wave<br>- Earthquake<br>- Taunt / Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Waterfall is Gyarados's most powerful STAB move. Thunder Wave allows Gyarados to cripple faster foes. Earthquake provides decent all-field coverage. Taunt allows Gyarados to deal with Pokemon that like to play around with status and setting up. Protect can be used in the last slot to scout opponents.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The HP and Defense EVs allow Gyarados to survive hard hits such as Mega Kangaskhan's Return as well as Garchomp's Rock Slide. 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Gyarados's Attack, allowing it to leave lasting dents in opposing Pokemon. Alternatively, 68 Attack EVs can be run to boost Gyarados's Attack a moderate amount in exchange for more Speed EVs to allow Gyarados to Speed tie with neutral-natured maximum base 58 Speed Pokemon such as Scrafty and outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Mawile. Alternatively, full Speed investment can allow for faster utility moves against threats such as Smeargle. If you choose to run 252 Speed EVs, be certain to run Jolly as well. Sitrus Berry can give Gyarados immediate health recovery once its HP gets low enough, whereas Leftovers provides residual HP recovery throughout the course of the battle. However, Leftovers should not be run unless Gyarados is using Protect, as it otherwise cannot utilize the item fully. Intimidate allows Gyarados to passively support teammates lacking in Defense.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Be certain to keep Gyarados away from Electric-type attacks, as it can rarely take any Electric-type attack. Use Taunt against Pokemon such as Amoonguss to prevent them from either sleeping one of your Pokemon or using Rage Powder. If running Protect, use it to scout if you're unsure of what the opponent is going to do.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that appreciate the Intimidate support go nicely with Gyarados, such as Mega Alakazam and Gengar. Pokemon that can remove the threatening Rotom-W, such as Amoonguss, make for good partners as well. Lastly, Pokemon that can remove opposing Amoonguss, such as Talonflame or Rotom-H, are good teammates.</p>

<h1>Choice Band</h1>

<div class=set>
    Gyarados @ Choice Band<br>
    Ability: Intimidate<br>
    EVs: 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Waterfall<br>- Ice Fang<br>- Stone Edge<br>- Earthquake / Return
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Waterfall is a good STAB move with a chance to flinch foes. Ice Fang hits Salamence and Garchomp very hard. Stone Edge wrecks Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-H. Earthquake can be used for a spread attack, albeit a slightly underwhelming one, in the last slot. Return can be used in the fourth slot instead for a 100% accurate coverage attack for Pokemon Gyarados would hit for neutral damage anyway, such as Rotom-W.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs maximize Gyarados's damage output. This set runs enough Speed to outrun minimum Speed Rotom-W. The rest is invested in HP for a boost to Gyarados's bulk. Choice Band boosts Gyarados's Attack, and Intimidate lowers the foe's Attack stat whenever Gyarados switches in.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Don't be afraid to switch often for more Intimidates, as it will cripple some Pokemon and Gyarados is bulky enough to take attacks. Make sure to stay away from Rotom-W and other Electric-types, as they can beat Gyarados with one of their 4x super effective STAB attacks.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that deal with Rotom-W and Amoonguss, such as Ferrothorn, generally are good teammates. Example of these Pokemon include Amoonguss itself, Talonflame, Rotom-H, and Mega Charizard Y.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Bounce is an option on normal Gyarados for a STAB attack, but it is unnecessary, and therefore not worth it. Bite can be used on Mega Gyarados for STAB coverage, though it is also generally unnecessary. Aqua Tail and Stone Edge can be used with a Wide Lens for powerful, yet accurate, moves. The issue with this is that there is still a chance to miss, and the moves typically have very limited uses that are not already covered by the other moves. Lastly, Splash Plate can be used for a minor power boost to Gyarados's Water-type STAB attack, but Gyaradosite, Choice Band, and Leftovers provide more utility.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn can wall Gyarados with ease, taking abysmal damage from Earthquake and Ice Fang while whittling Gyarados down with Leech Seed. If Gyarados has Mega Evolved, Ferrothorn can more easily defeat it with a Grass-type STAB move.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom-W</strong>: Rotom-W does not care what any non-Mega Gyarados does, and it OHKOes with Thunderbolt. It can also leave hefty dents in Mega Gyarados as well.</p>

<p><strong>Amoonguss</strong>: While Amoonguss doesn't like Choice Band-boosted Ice Fangs or Taunt, it can deal with any other form of Gyarados that lacks those moves.</p>

<p><strong>Attack Drops</strong>: Will-O-Wisp neuters Gyarados, rendering it essentially useless. Intimidate does the same thing on a lesser scale. Non-Dragon Dance Gyarados become pretty useless after having their Attack dropped.</p>

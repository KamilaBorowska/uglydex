<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>On paper, Talonflame looks like yet another mediocre Pokemon, similar the rest of its friends found in the early routes. However, Talonflame has a saving grace in the form of Gale Wings, which turns it into a premier Pokemon with its ability to destroy opposing Pokemon with powerful priority Brave Birds and benefit the team with its plethora of support options. However, the skies aren't completely clear for Talonflame, as it is weak to the common Water-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves that plague the metagame, has rather mediocre stats to back up its amazing ability, and has a movepool that is nothing to write home about, therefore limiting its options. However, don't let these shortcomings put you off from using Talonflame, as it is by far one of the most potent attackers and effective supporters in the metagame.</p>

<h1>Offensive Support</h1>

<div class=set>
    Talonflame @ Life Orb / Sky Plate<br>
    Ability: Gale Wings<br>
    EVs: 84 HP / 252 Atk / 172 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Brave Bird<br>- Flare Blitz<br>- Tailwind / Quick Guard<br>- Protect / Quick Guard
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Gale Wings is incredibly useful, as it grants Talonflame priority Tailwind and the most powerful priority move in the game in the form of Brave Bird. Brave Bird is Talonflame's main attack due to the priority it gains from Gale Wings, ripping through Pokemon such as Amoonguss. Talonflame's secondary STAB move, Flare Blitz, complements Brave Bird fairly well; the two moves form a potent combination resisted only by the Rock-type and a few other dual typings. Tailwind is a priority move that boosts the Speed of the entire team for a few turns. Protect is a staple in Doubles for its ability to scout the opponent's moves and protect the user from damage, especially important considering the ability to double target. Quick Guard can be used in the place of Tailwind or Protect as the utility it provides is incredibly handy on Talonflame. Quick Guard blocks Fake Out from the likes of Mega Kangaskhan, can give your teammate a free turn to move, and has been buffed in that it no longer fails when used in succession.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EVs enable Talonflame to hit with as much power as possible as well as outpace max Speed Mega Kangaskhan. As a result, Talonflame can block Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out with Quick Guard and utilize Brave Bird to nullify Sucker Punch. Talonflame can run max Speed to outpace every Fake Out user in the metagame excluding max Speed Raichu, which Speed ties with it, and max Speed Weavile, which outpaces it anyway. This also enables Talonflame to outpace most opposing Talonflame, which can be a valuable asset. However, maximum Speed investment is unadvised as Raichu and Weavile are too uncommon, and Talonflame can mess with opposing Talonflame with Quick Guard. The item of choice depends on what you want Talonflame to do: it can hold a Sky Plate for a little more survivability at the cost of power, or a Life Orb for the extra power, enabling a guaranteed 2HKO on 244 HP Bold Coba Berry Ludicolo with Brave Bird at the cost of survivability. An Adamant nature is run as there is no reason to run a Jolly nature, as Talonflame will use Brave Bird, Tailwind, Quick Guard and Protect most of the time.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Bring Talonflame in early-game to support the team with Tailwind and Quick Guard. Make your move accordingly based around the lead match-up, using Quick Guard turn one when against a lead Kangaskhan, setting up Tailwind when you feel it is needed, such as when facing a particularly fast team, and using Brave Bird or Flare Blitz to deal with opposing threats such as Ludicolo and Scizor. As you can imagine, mirror match-ups consist of many mind games, so make sure to play conservatively in these situations, predicting your opponent's move and using your 45 seconds well. Misprediction might get Talonflame KOed, for example, by Garchomp's Rock Slide when it uses Brave Bird and the opponent uses Quick Guard.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Steel-types such as Scizor and Aegislash have good synergy with Talonflame and can deal with the Rock-types that resist Talonflame's attacks. Rotom-W and Rotom-H can deal with opposing Talonflame as well as deal Mega Charizard Y, and the latter can take advantage of the sun that Mega Charizard Y summons. Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Aerodactyl can also deal with opposing Talonflame, and the former can also deal with Rotom-H. Amoonguss walls Rotom-W and threatens it with a STAB Giga Drain. Mega Charizard Y can summon sun, boosting the power of Talonflame's Flare Blitz and compensating its slight lack of power when it holds a Sky Plate. Talonflame and Garchomp create a terrifying offensive core with excellent offensive synergy; Talonflame covers Fairy-types and Ferrothorn while Garchomp covers Talonflame and Rotom-H.</p>

<h1>Choice Band</h1>

<div class=set>
    Talonflame @ Choice Band<br>
    Ability: Gale Wings<br>
    EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Brave Bird<br>- Flare Blitz<br>- U-turn<br>- Tailwind / Me First / Aerial Ace
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Brave Bird is the move that Talonflame will generally be using most of the time due to its STAB boost and Gale Wings. Flare Blitz is mainly a backup move for when locking Talonflame into Brave Bird isn't optimal, and deals with Pokemon such as Scizor and Aegislash better than Brave Bird does. U-turn is useful on this set as it allows Talonflame to escape from a bad situation and is Talonflame's best move for Tyranitar. The last moveslot is mainly filler, but there are a few options to consider. Tailwind serves the same purpose as on the standard set, and can help bluff a non-Choice set. However, Talonflame is basically forced to switch out on the following turn after using Tailwind, so it will soon be clear that Talonflame is Choice-locked. Before setting up Tailwind, Me First helps Talonflame against Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, stealing Rock Slide and OHKOing them. However, the move is a little situational. Aerial Ace can also be used in the fourth moveslot as a recoil-free way of dealing with weakened opponents, but is very weak and forces Talonflame to switch out after using it.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EVs are to outpace opposing Talonflame and maximize its firepower. An Adamant nature and Choice Band augment Talonflame's offensive capabilities, turning it into a nuke that can spam Brave Bird with little worry. A Jolly nature is worthless, as Talonflame is mostly going to spam Brave Bird.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Brave Bird is most often the best move to use, though it should not be used recklessly. Write down the opposing team and refer to it whenever you are making decisions, as you will often find situations mid-game where Brave Bird is not the best move to use. Switch strategically to ensure that the Pokemon you are switching in takes as little damage as possible. An example includes luring a Rock Slide with Talonflame and switching into Garchomp to take the hit, allowing Talonflame to come in later and lock itself into the appropriate move. General decisions include using U-turn when Tyranitar is on the opponent's side of the field, using Flare Blitz when Aegislash or Scizor is a threat to your team, and using Talonflame's filler move when you deem it to be appropriate.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Rotom-W and Rotom-H can deal with opposing Talonflame, and the latter can deal with Mega Charizard Y very well. Rotom-M, on the other hand, is a great Pokemon to deal with opposing Rotom-W and Tyranitar. Tyranitar can deal with Rotom-H, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard Y well, though it must be wary of Talonflame's U-turn and Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan can prevent Rock Slides and enable Talonflame to U-turn out safely and bring in a Pokemon with a better match-up against the opponent's Pokemon. Fake Out users can also give Talonflame a turn to set up with Tailwind or utilize another move. The combination of Scizor and Talonflame is effective, as Scizor can deal with the Rock-types that wall Talonflame and Talonflame can deal with Aegislash, which can cause problems for Scizor that lack Thief. However, Scizor is walled by Rotom-W and Rotom-H, and must be wary of the former's Will-O-Wisp and the latter's Overheat. Garchomp also makes an excellent partner, as it can defeat Rotom-H, though it must be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Amoonguss is capable of dealing with Rotom-W and Tyranitar as well as supporting Talonflame with Spore and Rage Powder. However, it must be wary of Crunch and Rock Slide from Tyranitar. Lastly, Mold Breaker Haxorus can 2HKO 252 HP / 44 Def Rotom-W and always OHKO Rotom-H with Earthquake.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Though it doesn't have the best offensive movepool, Talonflame has a very good supportive movepool and a few other offensive options to consider. Talonflame has a wide range of support moves that can go on the standard set, the most notable of which are Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Roost. However, these are generally outclassed by the options that are currently in the set. Overheat can be used on the standard set with a Mild nature and an EV spread of 172 Atk / 252 SpA / 84 Spe however, such a set packs a weaker Brave Bird and forces Talonflame to run Life Orb, which may be unattractive due to the recoil it induces. On the subject of Overheat, Talonflame has a range of special moves that it can use, such as Hidden Power - most notably Flying - Fire Blast, Flamethrower, and Solar Beam. Acrobatics can be used over Aerial Ace on the Choice Band set in case Talonflame is on the receiving end of a Knock Off. However, Knock Off is too uncommon to recommend preparing for, and Aerial Ace is stronger when Talonflame holds an item.</p>

<p>A Charti Berry or Wacan Berry can be used with an EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe to guarantee that Talonflame can survive Brave Tyranitar's Rock Slide, even after Sandstorm damage, or Modest Rotom-H's Thunderbolt. Natural Gift can be used to give Talonflame a better way to deal with Rotom-W and Tyranitar in tandem with Liechi Berry and Salac Berry, respectively. While the former item could have utility if not used up by Natural Gift, the latter is mostly unnecessary, as the Speed boost is irrelevant to most moves bar Flare Blitz. Furthermore, Natural Gift can only be used once without access to Recycle or Harvest, two things that Talonflame lacks, so it isn't recommended. Lastly, Talonflame has access to Swords Dance and Bulk Up to boost its stats, but Talonflame isn't going to be around for long enough to utilize these moves well.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-W and Rotom-H are Talonflame's worst enemies, as it cannot do much damage to either of them with its STAB moves. Mega Manectric can deal with Talonflame well due to Intimidate, though it must be wary of a sun-boosted Flare Blitz. Mega Ampharos can tank Talonflame's moves better than Mega Manectric can, but doesn't have access to Intimidate.</p>

<p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar resists both of Talonflame's STAB attacks, although it must be wary of Talonflame's U-turn, as it will 2HKO 92 HP / 124 Def Tyranitar 5.1% of the time. Furthermore, Tyranitar is vulnerable to double-targeting and could be KOed that turn. Rhydon and Rhyperior completely wall Talonflame, but they must be wary of one of Talonflame's usual teammates: Rotom-W. Aerodactyl gives Talonflame competition as a Tailwind user and can OHKO it with its STAB Rock Slide. However, like Rhyperior, Aerodactyl must be wary of Rotom-W.</p>

<p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro and Rotom-W can tank both of Talonflame's STAB attacks and retaliate with STAB Scald and Hydro Pump, respectively. However, the former must be wary of Talonflame's U-turn. Azumarill is capable of tanking Talonflame's Brave Bird and OHKOing back with STAB Waterfall or Aqua Jet, though the latter requires some prior damage. However, it must be wary of Rotom-W, which can OHKO with Thunderbolt. Gyarados is similar to Azumarill, though it trades Aqua Jet for Intimidate, making it an even better way to deal with Talonflame.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Guard</strong>: Quick Guard users such as Mienshao and opposing Talonflame play mind games with Talonflame, as they are capable of wasting its turn with Quick Guard and allowing a teammate to cripple or KO it.</p>

<p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Scrafty and Salamence, can weaken Talonflame and force it to switch out.</p>

<p><strong>Rock-type Moves</strong>: Pokemon such as Garchomp and Salamence often carry Rock Slide for coverage. They can often take a hit and OHKO Talonflame in return.</p>

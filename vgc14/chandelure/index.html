<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Chandelure sports a unique Fire / Ghost typing that gives it three useful immunities, which when combined with its high Special Attack stat and versatility in Speed control through Trick Room or Choice Scarf gives it many uses in VGC. Unfortunately, it sports 5 weaknesses to common attacking types in VGC and hates most spread and priority moves. On top of that, common Pokemon resist one of its STAB moves, including Rotom-W and Garchomp, which can be a downside tousing Chandelure.</p>

<h1>Special Attacker</h1>

<div class=set>
    Chandelure @ Focus Sash<br>
    Ability: Flash Fire / Infiltrator<br>
    EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Heat Wave<br>- Shadow Ball<br>- Will-O-Wisp / Substitute / Trick Room<br>- Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Heat Wave is Chandelure's main STAB move and can chip HP off of both the opponent's Pokemon. Shadow Ball is Chandelure's strongest STAB move against a single target, though. Will-O-Wisp is used for inflicting burns and lowering the power of physical attackers that threaten Chandelure, such as Garchomp. Substitute is an alternative to Will-O-Wisp that helps Chandelure avoid damage and status. It is also great to use because Chandelure can practically get one up for free on arguably the 3 best Mega Evolutions in the metagame: Kangaskhan, Mawile, and Charizard Y, with all of its immunities. Trick Room is the last alternative to Will-O-Wisp, and if Chandelure is running it, give Chandelure 0 Speed IVs, run a Quiet nature, and move the Speed EVs to HP. Protect allows Chandelure to avoid taking damage from attacks.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>A Modest nature is used to maximize Chandelure's Special Attack stat. Max investment in Speed and Special Attack is to hit hard and fast. Focus Sash gives Chandelure one guaranteed attack and sometimes even more. Flash Fire is better than Infiltrator, as it gives Chandelure an immunity to Fire-type movesso they don't break Chandelure's Focus Sash.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Make sure to use Protect when necessary, such as when you know a spread move is coming. If Flash Fire is Chandelure's ability, use it to absorb Fire-type moves for Pokemon that have a weakness to the type, such as Ferrothorn and Scizor.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Some of the best teammates for this set are Pokemon that enjoy Fire-type coverage, such as Mawile and Amoonguss. It also likes Pokemon that can avoid Ground-type moves, such as Rotom-W and Talonflame. Pokemon that have access to Wide Guard, such as Aegislash and Mienshao, also make for great partners. Lastly, if you are using Trick Room, then other slow Pokemon that can benefit from Trick Room, such as Ferrothorn and Reuniclus, would be good partners for Chandelure.</p>

<h1>Choice Scarf</h1>

<div class=set>
    Chandelure @ Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Infiltrator / Flash Fire<br>
    EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Overheat<br>- Shadow Ball<br>- Heat Wave<br>- Energy Ball / Hidden Power Ice
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Overheat is Chandelure's main move on this set, as it can OHKO almost every non-bulky Pokemon that does not resist it, such as Mega Gengar and Klefki. However, it lowers Chandelure's Special Attack by two stages. Shadow Ball Chandelure's strongest Ghost-type STAB move and has no downsides. Heat Wave is a STAB spread movethat is great for bypassing Protect and chipping the health of multiple opposing Pokemon. Energy Ball provides Chandelure with coverage against Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon, whose STAB moves deal super effective damage to Chandelure. Hidden Power Ice is an alternative to Energy Ball that covers Chandelure's Ground-type weakness, even though Shadow Ball does just as much damage to them, as well as hits Dragon-types, which resist its Fire-type STAB moves. Hidden Power Ice is great for surprise KOs on Garchomp and Salamance.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Either Flash Fire or Infiltrator can be used on this set, as both are efficient. Flash Fire gives Chandelure an immunity to Fire-type moves and boosts Chandelure's own if Chandelure is hit by one, while Infiltrator allows Chandelure's attacks to go right through Substitutes and dual screens.Maximum investment in Speed and Special Attack allows Chandelure to hit hard and fast. A Timid nature is necessary, as it allows Chandelure to outspeed most Pokemon when coupled with a Choice Scarf.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>With a Choice Scarf, Chandelure is a sitting duck for Sucker Punch. Also look out for rain, which endangers Chandelure and weakens its Fire-type moves. You should makeattacking frailerPokemon a priority. As such, Chandelure's job is to take out fast attackers first, then bulkier Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Priority users, such as Meowstic, are good for taking out and crippling foe priority users. Pokemon that enjoy Chandelure's Flash Fire ability are bulky Grass- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn. Chandelure enjoys having bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, as teammates, as they can cover a lot of its weaknesses. Garchomp is a great teammate, as it can take out weather setters. Flying-type Pokemon, as well as Pokemon with Levitate, are good for avoiding Ground-type moves, which Chandelure is weak to. Chandelure absolutely loves Pokemon with access Wide Guard because it is weak to almost all spread moves.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Flame Body is usable on both sets, as it can help cripple physical attackers, including Kangaskhan and Aegislash. Hex is a nice move for both sets, especially if you have a Prankster user that can spread status, such as Meowstic. Trick Room + Imprison is a nice counter to dedicated Trick Room teams. Air Balloon can be used on the first set to avoid Ground-type moves. Choice Specs can also be used for more power.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Most priority moves aresuper effective against Chandelure.</p>

<p><strong>Spread Moves</strong>: Almost all spread moves, including Rock Slide, Surf, and Earthquake, are super effective against Chandelure.</p>

<p><strong>Resistant Pokemon</strong>: Even with Chandelure's base 145 Special Attack, Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Tyranitar can wall and OHKO it in return.</p>

<p><strong>Rain</strong>: Rain lowers the power of Chandelure's STAB Fire-type moves and increases the power of super effective Water-type moves.</p>

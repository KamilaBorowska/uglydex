<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Gourgeist-XL has a lot of issues in OU that prevent it from being a spectacular Pokemon. To start, common offensive Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Charizard X, Heatran, and Mega Houndoom are immune to Will-O-Wisp, take almost no damage from Seed Bomb, and can easily obliterate Gourgeist-XL with their respective Fire-type STAB move. Similarly, offensive Flying-types such as Tornadus-T, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir can easily break through Gourgeist-XL with their Flying-type STAB moves, as can offensive Ghost-, Dark-, and Ice-types with their respective STAB moves. To add insult to injury, it's hopelessly walled by one of the best defensive Pokemon in tier, Mega Sableye, and has special bulk too low to take any neutral special hit, leaving it only able to handle a select group of attackers. Thankfully for Gourgeist-XL, the Pokemon it is capable of handling are both threatening and common enough to warrant Gourgeist-XL's usage on stall, balanced, and bulky offensive teams. Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Assault Vest Azumarill, Keldeo, Breloom, Excadrill, Diggersby, Chesnaught, and Mega Swampert are a few of the of the various offensive monsters Gourgeist-XL is able to go head-to-head with. Will-O-Wisp's Attack reduction helps Gourgeist-XL out a lot in walling these physical attackers and deters them from trying to set up on it. Leech Seed is an equally annoying move that not only restores Gourgeist-XL's health but also drains it from its enemy.</p>

<h1>Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Gourgeist-Super @ Leftovers<br>

    EVs: 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 SpD<br>
    Impish Nature<br>
    - Will-O-Wisp<br>- Leech Seed<br>- Synthesis<br>- Seed Bomb / Shadow Sneak
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers by halving their attack and forcing them to take residual damage. Leech Seed complements Will-O-Wisp well, as it assists in taking HP away from Gourgeist-XL's foes. Leech Seed is great for using on a predicted switch, as it wears down Gourgeist-XL's checks and counters and gives Gourgeist-XL a little bit of recovery before it has to switch. Synthesis provides semi-reliable recovery for Gourgeist-XL, and lets Gourgeist-XL stall out Pokemon by constantly recovering, but it must be used sparingly due to its low PP. One problem with Synthesis is that the amount of HP it recovers is lessened in the rain and the sand; however, this isn't a huge deal because Gourgeist-XL can wall both Excadrill and Swampert without needing recovery. Seed Bomb lets Gourgeist-XL do reasonable damage to its foes; it lets it break Mega Lopunny's Substitute and easily 2HKO Keldeo. If you already have Substitute Mega Lopunny covered, Gourgeist-XL can use Shadow Sneak over Seed Bomb. Because of its priority and coverage, Shadow Sneak allows Gourgeist-XL to beat many of its common switch-ins and checks, including Latios and Mega Gardevoir. Phantom Force is a much more powerful Ghost-type STAB move that takes 2 turns and thus lets Gourgeist-XL stall out extra turns of passive damage from Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed. Rock Slide is another possibility for the fourth moveslot, as it lets Gourgeist-XL hit Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame on the switch, both of which are otherwise able to easily check Gourgeist-XL.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Max HP EVs are used so that Gourgeist-XL is reasonably bulky both specially and physically. 160 Defense EVs and an Impish nature are used to ensure Jolly Mega Lopunny can never 2HKO Gourgeist-XL after Stealth Rock damage with High Jump Kick. However, Adamant Mega Lopunny still has a fair chance to do so. The remainder of EVs are placed in Special Defense so that Specs Keldeo has only a minimal chance to 2HKO Gourgeist-XL after Stealth Rock damage. A spread of 252 HP / 252 Def could work if you're worried about the uncommon Ice Punch Mega Metagross and don't care about Gourgeist-XL reliably taking two Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pumps from Keldeo after Stealth Rock. Frisk lets Gourgeist-XL scout its foe's item. For example, it lets Gourgeist-XL detect what Mega Stone Charizard has, if Landorus-T is has a Choice Scarf, and if Keldeo is running Leftovers, and as such is likely to be running a Calm Mind set. Finally, Leftovers is used on Gourgeist-XL for the passive recovery.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Leading with Gourgeist-XL is generally a good idea because it lets Gourgeist-XL scout the opponent's lead with Frisk. Later in the game, Gourgeist-XL should switch in without hesitation on the various Pokemon it handles, such as Landorus-T, Mega Metagross, Mega Lopunny, Azumarill, Keldeo, Mega Scizor that lack both Swords Dance and Knock Off, Excadrill, Diggersby, Terrakion, Breloom, Chesnaught, and Mega Swampert. Gourgeist should use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers. If you run into a physically-oriented Pokemon that has a slight chance to 2HKO Gourgeist-XL, it's usually safest not to switch in directly but get in on a free switch and proceed to tank the hit and burn the foe. You should use Leech Seed to inflict more passive damage on the opposing Pokemon. You should use it specifically on the opponent's switch to a non-Grass-type counter, because it lets Gourgeist-XL recover HP while simultaneously weakening Pokemon that can switch into Gourgeist-XL.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Gourgeist-XL can be used on stall, balanced, and even bulky offensive teams teams; therefore it can have both offensive and defensive teammates. Magic Guard Clefable walls Gourgeist-XL, as it's unaffected by all of Gourgeist-XL's passive damage attempts. Responses to it, such as Mega Metagross and Heatran, are thus very useful. Flying-types such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Tornadus-T make for great checks to Gourgeist-XL. Answers to them such as Rhyperior, Heatran, Zapdos, and Mega Manectric can be helpful teammates. Rhyperior also helps out against a common counter to Gourgeist, Mega Charizard X. Other answers to Mega Charizard , such as Slowbro and Quagsire, can also be good teammates. Mega Charizard Y is also a problem for Gourgeist-XL, so Latias, Latios, and Mega Altaria can be good teammates. Gourgeist-XL hates having to deal with Bisharp a lot, so Keldeo, Cobalion, and Infernape can prove to be helpful partners. Finally, Goodra, specially defensive Manaphy, Tentacruel, Hippowdon, and Mandibuzz can all help out with Gourgeist-XL's weakness to Gengar, and Clefable, Togekiss, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Houndoom can all remedy Gourgeist-XL's weakness to Mega Sableye.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Trick Room can be used to set up the field condition for Trick Room reliant teammates. Foul Play can be used to specifically target physical attackers even more, punishing them for setting up. Rocky Helmet can be used to rack up damage against physical attackers, specifically Landorus-T, which will think twice before using U-turn.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Knock Off-wielding Dark-types such as Bisharp, Weavile, Crawdaunt, and Mega Absol can deal massive damage to Gourgeist-XL; however, Gourgeist-XL can burn all bar Mega Absol, which it 2HKOes with Seed Bomb, so the opponent shouldn't try to switch any of them into Gourgeist-XL.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Houndoom, and Heatran are immune to Will-O-Wisp and can OHKO Gourgeist-XL with their STAB moves. Heatran and Houndoom are especially notable for gaining a power boost to their Fire-type moves upon switching in on a Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar can easily switch in on a Seed Bomb and doesn't care too much about being burned or being Leech Seeded because it always OHKOes Gourgeist-XL with Shadow Ball. However, it must be wary about Shadow Sneak. Mega Sableye reflects Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed back at Gourgeist-XL, takes very little from both Seed Bomb and Shadow Sneak, and can use Gourgeist-XL as Calm Mind bait.</p>

<p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Mega Pinsir, Tornadus-T, and Talonflame all OHKO Gourgeist-XL with their Flying-type STAB move. However, all except Talonflame must be wary of being burned. Togekiss also handles Gourgeist-XL well and it doesn't have to worry about being burned by virtue of being a special attacker.</p>

<p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: If Gourgeist-XL is using Shadow Sneak as its attacking move, various Substitute users, including Mega Gyarados and Mega Lopunny, can easily check it. They all must be wary of switching in on a Will-O-Wisp, however. </p>

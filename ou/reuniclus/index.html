<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>On paper, Reuniclus might seem somewhat mediocre, as it has a relatively poor defensve typing, is hopelessly walled by one of the most common and threatening Pokemon in the tier in Calm Mind Mega Sableye, and is easily taken advantage of by some of the most threatening Pokemon in OU, including Bisharp, Weavile, Mega Gyarados, Gengar, Mega Scizor, Mega Heracross, and Heracross. It also faces enormous competition as a Calm Mind sweeper with Clefable, which boasts a superior defensive typing and deals with Mega Sableye well. Thankfully, Reuniclus possesses a couple of traits that give it a niche, the first of which is STAB Psyshock. Psyshock allows Reuniclus to do physical damage to targets and thus win Calm Mind wars and easily damage Chansey. Furthermore, Reuniclus's Psychic typing and bulk, while not spectacular, are respectable and allow it to safely check or counter and set up on many offensive Pokemon, including Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, specially offensive Mega Altaria, Mega Venusaur, Choice Scarf Heatran, Magnezone, Mega Diancie, and Mega Manectric. Additionally, its Magic Guard ability helps it check offensive teams and defensive teams alike. It renders Reuniclus immune to Stealth Rock as well as Toxic and Leech Seed, which are commonly used as defensive teams' answers to setup sweepers. Reuniclus takes advantage of many defensive Pokemon in OU, such as defensive Mega Altaria, Mega Venusaur, Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Hippowdon, and thus helps out stall teams tremendously when playing against other stall teams.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Calm Mind allows Reuniclus to boost its Special Attack so that it can start doing insane damage and Special Defense so that it becomes impenetrable specially. Psyshock is a fairly powerful Psychic-type STAB move that lets Reuniclus counter Poison-types, such as Mega Venusaur. Psyshock also lets Reuniclus win Calm Mind wars and hit Chansey hard at +6, unlike Psychic. Focus Blast covers the Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran, that Reuniclus easily sets up on. It also lets Reuniclus OHKO Bisharp on the switch and set up on Tyranitar that lack Crunch. Shadow Ball hits Steel-types neutrally, so it still hits them harder than Psyshock and can 2HKO most of them at +6. The main reason you'd choose it is so Reuniclus can beat bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Victini, and Cresselia much more easily than it could with Psyshock. It also lets Reuniclus beat support Mega Sableye and gives it a fighting chance against Calm Mind Mega Sableye and Calm Mind Mega Slowbro in Calm Mind wars. A drawback of using Shadow Ball over Focus Blast is that it makes Reuniclus weak to most Pursuit users, which it could otherwise severely cripple with Focus Blast. Recover is necessary for continually recovering Reuniclus's HP while it is setting up and after it switches in on Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum HP EVs and 56 Special Defense EVs let Reuniclus almost always be able to switch into Naive Mega Diancie's Moonblast, take the next one, and then beat it. 68 Special Defense EVs could be used instead to guarantee avoiding the 2HKO, but Reuniclus would lose out on the ability to counter some physical threats, such as Life Orb Terrakion. The remaining EVs are put in Defense, and a Bold nature is used so that Reuniclus is as physically bulky as possible with the Special Defense investment. Leftovers are used for passive recovery, and Magic Guard is the ability of choice, as it makes Reuniclus immune to status damage and entry hazard damage.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Do not try to sweep with Reuniclus unless all of its checks and counters have been removed or you have a plan for luring them in and defeating them, such as using Focus Blast instead of Calm Mind or Psyshock to hit Bisharp on the switch. Once all of Reuniclus's checks and counters are gone, switch Reuniclus in, and alternate between Calm Mind and Recover until Reuniclus is powerful enough to win in the least amount of turns. Try to make sure you don't have to rely on Focus Blast to 2HKO a lot of Pokemon, as it misses frequently and has low PP. Reuniclus takes zero damage from Toxic, Stealth Rock, and Spikes, so don't be afraid to constantly switch it in and out. It laughs at many common defensive Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn and Heatran; Reuniclus should switch into them and start using Calm Mind. Reuniclus, thanks to its good bulk and fair typing, can also switch into common offensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, Mega Diancie, and Mega Lopunny and proceed to use Calm Mind.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Reuniclus is very weak to Mega Sableye, especially Calm Mind variants. Answers to it such as Mega Altaria, Clefable, Sylveon, and Mega Charizard X can prove to be excellent teammates for Reuniclus. Reuniclus is also weak to Bisharp; as such, Pokemon such as defensive Garchomp, Quagsire, and Zapdos are all useful teammates. Gengar is a troublesome foe for Reuniclus. To combat it, Hippowdon, Tentacruel, Mandibuzz, and Goodra can be used. Reuniclus finds Bug-types, such as Mega Scizor and Mega Beedrill, hard to deal with as well. Mega Charizard X, Quagsire, and Zapdos handle the former well, while Quagsire, Landorus-T, and Mega Aerodactyl handle the latter.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Regenerator is a nice ability that lets Reuniclus recover health simply by switching out, but that isn't very necessary for a Calm Mind sweeper. If you want to use Regenerator, it would make more sense to use Reuniclus as a bulky offensive pivot with Choice Specs. Reuniclus could use a Life Orb, as with Magic Guard Reuniclus is immune to its recoil damage. This would boost the power of its moves substantially, but it typically isn't worth giving up the recovery it gains from Leftovers. A status Orb could be used to burn or poison Reuniclus and thus prevent it from falling asleep or getting paralyzed. However, there are better status absorbers for defensiveteams. The status Orbs could also be used alongside Trick to cripple defensive Pokemon while gaining their Leftovers. An offensive Trick Room set could be used with Life Orb and three attacks, as Reuniclus is extremely powerful and fares well against offensive teams. However, offense has multiple means of stalling Trick Room turns and checking Reuniclus, and this set is practically useless against any team that is not offensive, so it is generally an inferior option. Hidden Power Fighting hits Steel-types half as hard as Focus Blast does but has more accuracy and PP. Heal Block prevents opposing Pokemon from healing. In particular, it prevents Slowbro from using Slack Off and Mega Sableye from using Recover.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye is one of the most prevalent Pokemon in OU and is immune to both Psyshock and Focus Blast. It can run a Calm Mind set itself that uses Reuniclus as setup bait, or just flat out wall Reuniclus with a utility set. Do note that the utility set will lose to Reuniclus that have Shadow Ball.</p>

<p><strong>Strong Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Ghost-, Dark-, and Bug-types all hit Reuniclus super effectively with their STAB moves. Gengar, Bisharp, Weavile, Mega Gyarados, Mega Scizor, Volcarona, Mega Heracross, and Guts Heracross are all examples of such Pokemon. Do note, however, that few of these Pokemon actually want to switch in on Reuniclus, as it's capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing almost all of them. Additionally, Reuniclus's bulk allows it to handle moderately powerful Pokemon, such as Mega Lopunny, but more powerful wallbreakers, such as Mega Charizard X and Kabutops, can easily muscle past it.</p>

<p><strong>Unaware Pokemon</strong>: Reuniclus is reliant on Calm Mind to do impressive damage. Unaware Pokemon, namely Quagsire and Clefable, ignore Calm Mind boosts and thus make great switch-ins to Reuniclus. However, neither can 2HKO Reuniclus without a boosting move of its own, so the battle tends to turn into a PP war.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Slowbro</strong>: Calm Mind Mega Slowbro uses Focus Blast Reuniclus as setup bait. As long as Reuniclus isn't at +1 before Mega Slowbro is, Calm Mind Mega Slowbro will only lose if Reuniclus hits it with a critical hit. However, Reuniclus with Shadow Ball can beat Mega Slowbro more easily.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Emboar's great STAB combination and Reckless make it a powerful physical wallbreaker that is extremely hard to wall. It also has the perfect movepool to abuse its ability, consisting of moves such as Flare Blitz, Wild Charge, and Head Smash. Emboar is also immune to burn, while also having a solid defensive typing that allows it to check threats such as Bisharp. However, it is quite slow, but access to Sucker Punch can somewhat remedy this. Emboar is also weak to common priority moves such as Brave Bird and Aqua Jet and is easily worn down due to its use of recoil moves and susceptibility to entry hazards.</p>

<h1>Wallbreaker</h1>

<div class=set>
    Emboar @ Life Orb / Choice Band<br>
    Ability: Reckless<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Flare Blitz<br>- Superpower<br>- Wild Charge<br>- Sucker Punch / Head Smash
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Flare Blitz and Superpower are two very powerful STAB moves, with Flare Blitz also being boosted by Reckless. Wild Charge is a must on Emboar, as it is allows it to hit bulky Water-types such as Azumarill, which could otherwise wall this set, while also being boosted by Reckless. Sucker Punch remedies Emboar's low Speed, but it should only be used in combination with Life Orb, as it is a horrible move to be locked into. Head Smash is also an option to hit Pokemon that wall Emboar's STAB combination, such as Mega Altaria, but it is inaccurate and best used with Choice Band.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Reckless is the only reason Emboar is used, as it turns Emboar from a mediocre physical attacker into an extremely powerful wallbreaker. Life Orb allows Emboar to switch moves and therefore makes it less reliant on prediction, but it wears down Emboar very quickly. Choice Band gives Emboar much more immediate power at the cost of locking it into a move. 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature maximize Emboar's Speed, allowing it to outpace Gliscor and defensive variants of Mega Altaria. The rest of the EVs are poured into Attack so that Emboar can hit harder.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Try to use Emboar to break down bulkier walls so that a teammate can muscle past them. You should be clicking Flare Blitz most of the time, as it is Emboar's strongest move and deals heavy damage even to Pokemon that resist it. Don't be afraid of playing recklessly, as Emboar's main job is to punch major holes in the opposing team. Sucker Punch only has 8 PP and can easily be taken advantage of; only use it in certain situations, such as against faster Pokemon that threaten to outspeed and KO Emboar.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Rotom-W has good synergy with Emboar; it is immune to Ground-type attacks and resists Water- and Flying-type attacks, while also having a slow Volt Switch to bring in Emboar safely. Healing Wish users such as Jirachi and Latias are good teammates, as they can fully heal Emboar and cure its status, giving it another shot at wallbreaking. Emboar greatly appreciates entry hazard support, which allows it to obtain crucial 2HKOs and OHKOs. Ferrothorn is capable of setting up Stealth Rock and Spikes; it can also take Water- and Psychic-type attacks for Emboar, while Emboar can sponge Fire-type attacks aimed at Ferrothorn. Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock, while Emboar can break down walls for Garchomp, allowing Garchomp to sweep late-game with Swords Dance. Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, Rock Polish Mega Metagross, Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo, and Swords Dance Talonflame all appreciate Emboar's ability to weaken their counters, such as Skarmory, Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T. Mega Gardevoir is also a fantastic partner for Emboar, as Emboar can easily defeat its checks and counters, such as Chansey, Skarmory, Scizor, and Ferrothorn, while Mega Gardevoir can defeat Mega Altaria and physical walls that can take Emboar's attacks. Emboar can easily be worn down by entry hazards, so entry hazard removal is strongly appreciated. Latios and Latias can Defog away hazards, while Emboar can ward off Bisharp. Starmie can spin away entry hazards, while Emboar is able to defeat Ferrothorn and Chansey.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Grass Knot can be used to deal with Pokemon such as Quagsire, Alomomola, and Hippowdon, which Emboar often lures in; however, they are already hit quite hard by Emboar's STAB moves. Choice Scarf allows Emboar to act as a revenge killer but takes away its main purpose of being a wallbreaker. Will-O-Wisp neuters common switch-ins to Emboar such as Landorus-T and Mega Altaria, but Emboar will either miss out on coverage or priority. A stallbreaker set with Taunt is also feasible, but Emboar is quite slow, and it would be walled by Mega Sableye.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: Emboar is weak to common priority moves such as Brave Bird and Aqua Jet, so it can easily be revenge killed. Talonflame's Brave Bird will hit before Emboar's Sucker Punch, while Azumarill resists Sucker Punch.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Altaria</strong>: Mega Altaria resists all of Emboar's moves but takes lots of damage from Head Smash. However, it can switch in on Emboar's STAB moves and has Roost to keep itself healthy, and Emboar will eventually KO itself because of recoil.</p>

<p><strong>Landorus-T</strong>: Landorus-T has Intimidate to weaken Emboar's attacks, but Flare Blitz can 2HKO it. However, it is still a solid check, being able to switch in on Superpower and Wild Charge and KO back with Earthquake.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Any Pokemon that can stomach a Sucker Punch, outspeed, and KO back is a good check to Emboar. Pokemon in this category include Keldeo, Garchomp, and Mega Diancie.</p>

<p><strong>Weather Sweepers</strong>: Common weather sweepers such as Excadrill and Mega Swampert can easily revenge kill Emboar when in their respective weather conditions. </p>

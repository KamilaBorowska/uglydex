<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>After the Aegislash ban, many powerful wallbreakers that Aegislash stopped now roam free without having to run additional coverage to get past it. By virtue of its typing and natural bulk, Doublade fills the void left by Aegislash's departure. Its ability to beat the likes of Mega Heracross, Mega Medicham, and Mega Gardevoir makes it a popular choice on stall teams. The fact that the metagame stopped preparing for its defensive typing after the Aegislash ban, such as Mega Medicham forfeiting Fire Punch and Mega Pinsir, Mega Heracross, and Terrakion forfeiting Earthquake, gives Doublade the ability to completely stop a few important threats. Its inmunity to trapping is a huge advantage over the likes of Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which need to run Shed Shell to avoid Shadow Tag and Magnet Pull from breaking them down. Unfortunately, Doublade's ability No Guard makes all moves used against it, notably Hydro Pump, Fire Blast, and Will-O-Wisp, always hit. Doublade's Special Defense stat is also very mediocre, meaning it gets severely worn down by a few things it is supposed to counter, namely Mega Gardevoir, Latias, and Latios. Doublade also suffers from a lack of recovery apart from Rest, making it require Heal Bell support to function efficiently and wall threats consistently.</p>

    Ability: No Guard<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD<br>

    - Gyro Ball<br>- Toxic<br>- Sleep Talk / Sacred Sword / Pursuit<br>- Rest
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Gyro Ball is a strong STAB move that deals a lot of damage to the threats Doublade counters. Toxic cripples common switch-ins such as Mega Charizard X and Y, Talonflame, Mega Manectric, and bulky Ground- and Water-types. Sleep Talk is useful so Doublade will not be complete setup bait after using Rest, while Sacred Sword is mainly for Bisharp, which would otherwise threaten Doublade, and to hit Heatran and Magnezone on the switch. Pursuit traps the likes of Gothitelle, Latias, and Latios. Rest is the only recovery Doublade gets and should only be used when Doublade gets weakened; it also cures its status.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EV spread and an Eviolite allow Doublade to take on Mega Gardevoir reliably; as Doublade is already physically bulky enough to take on Mega Pinsir, Mega Medicham, Mega Heracross, Terrakion, Hawlucha, Lucario, and Breloom. A Sassy nature and a 0 Speed IVs maximizes Gyro Ball's power, allowing Doublade to score crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs on the threats it checks or counters.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Doublade has an average Special Defense stat, so only switch in on resisted special attacks. Use Toxic early-game, as Doublade forces many switches, and be careful around Pursuit trappers. Try to avoid getting worn down by certain threats if you also need Doublade to take on other ones: for example, don't switch it in on Latios if there is also a Mega Gardevoir on the opposing team.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Doublade appreciates cleric support, so pairing it up with Chansey, Sylveon, or Clefable is a good idea. Doublade needs to be paired with a counter to wallbreakers that beat it, such as Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, and Crawdaunt, because they can take advantage of it very easily and threaten the rest of your team. Specially defensive Gliscor, Chansey, and Chesnaught, respectively, are options that cover them. Doublade should also be paired up with an additional check to Mega Gardevoir, as it cannot always take it on on its own, so Jirachi makes for a good partner. Bisharp is a big threat to Doublade; therefore, checks to it such as Chesnaught and Mega Charizard X are amazing partners. Mega Charizard X also enjoys Slowbro and Landorus-T getting Toxiced and takes on stallbreakers such as Mew and Gengar. Heatran also pairs up well with Doublade because it is able to switch into Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice, motivating it to use Focus Blast, which gives Doublade an easier time switching into it the next turn. It also takes on Hidden Power Fire Latios and Mega Charizard-X without Earthquake. Checks to Keldeo, Mega Charizard X, and Landorus, such as Mega Venusaur, Slowbro, and Mandibuzz, respectively, are recommended, as they can come in easily on Doublade.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Doublade doesn't have many options in its arsenal, but Shadow Sneak is usable for finishing off weakened opponents such as Mega Medicham and Mega Gardevoir and dealing chip damage before Doublade gets OHKOed. A Swords Dance set with Shadow Sneak, Sacred Sword, and a coverage move with an EV spread of 128 HP / 116 Atk / 48 Def / 216 SpD and a Sassy nature could work, as Doublade forces many switches; however, it's easily revenge killed by Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Talonflame, and it's easily walled by common Ground-types and physical walls.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Bisharp</strong>: Bisharp threatens Doublade with Pursuit and Knock Off and doesn't mind Gyro Ball or Toxic, but it must be careful not to switch into Sacred Sword.</p>

<p><strong>Mandibuzz</strong>: Mandibuzz dislikes Toxic, but it walls Doublade and can wear it down with Foul Play, remove its Eviolite with Knock Off, or even Taunt it so it can't use Rest.</p>

<p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, Thundurus, and Manectric are some special attackers that force Doublade out, however, they must be wary of switching into Toxic.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Gliscor walls Doublade completely and while Landorus-T and Hippowdon don't like to switch into Toxic, they can tank any of Doublade's hits and force it out.</p>

<p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur don't care about Doublade at all, and they can threaten it with Hidden Power Fire.</p>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Heatran is immune to Toxic and takes negligible damage from Gyro Ball, while Sacred Sword can't even 2HKO it. Skarmory and Ferrothorn can't do much damage to Doublade, but Doublade can't do much to them either, and they can set up Stealth Rock, use Leech Seed, or phaze Doublade.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y take negligible damage from Doublade's attacks and can proceed to destroy it or set up on it for free; however, they also dislike Toxic.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Although it might be overshadowed by Pokemon such as Terrakion and Garchomp as an entry hazard setter, Froslass is by no means unviable. A base 110 Speed makes it very fast, and in conjunction with its STAB Ice Beam, Froslass can beat many other hazard setters and Defoggers. As a Ghost-type, it can also spinblock for itself, so opponents can't KO it with Rapid Spin after knocking it down to its Focus Sash, wiping away its efforts. Unlike other suicide leads, Froslass makes use of Destiny Bond to ensure that you won't always be playing with a Pokemon down in exchange for hazards either, though this is reliant on good prediction, lest you waste a turn. Froslass also has a nice abidlity in Cursed Body that sometimes allows it to get an extra layer of hazards. However, some aspects of the metagame make it difficult for Froslass to be effective. Common priority users can limit it to one layer of Spikes, and the prevalence of Defog makes the Spikes that Froslass does set easier to remove. Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie are two prominent threats that prevent Froslass from getting any hazards up due to Magic Bounce. Finally, it should be emphasized once again that Froslass faces great competition from Pokemon such as Terrakion and Garchomp as a suicide lead for hyper offensive teams. If you use it, it's important to utilize its advantages over them, or you will end up with an inferior Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Taunt stops slower Pokemon from setting up boosts, laying entry hazards, or using Taunt themselves. Spikes is used to punish your opponent's switches and make life easier for your other Pokemon. Destiny Bond is a great move to take advantage of the fact that Froslass is a suicide lead and pairs well with Focus Sash. Ice Beam KOes common Stealth Rock leads like Garchomp and Landorus-T while also 2HKOing many common Defoggers.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Special Attack and Speed are maximized because Froslass is a frail, fast suicide lead, and the Special Attack investment nets it some important KOs such as a 2HKO on Latias. Cursed Body is a good ability to potentially get extra chances to set up by disabling an opponent's priority or Choice-locked attacks. Focus Sash is necessary to give Froslass an extra turn to use Spikes or Destiny Bond.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Froslass will almost always be your lead, unless the opponent has a Magic Bounce User such as Espeon or Mega Absol that renders it ineffective. If your opponent leads with something like Heatran or Gyarados that commonly sets up entry hazards or boosts, then it's best to use Taunt first. If instead they just have an all-out attacker, then start setting up Spikes. When Froslass is about to be KOed, a choice must be made. If you feel that you have enough layers of Spikes up and the attacking Pokemon is a threat to your team, then use Destiny Bond. If the Pokemon is not a threat, then an extra layer of Spikes may be more helpful. Be careful, as a savvy opponent might know about Destiny Bond, expect it, and not attack the second time. If your opponent leads with Talonflame with the goal of limiting you to one layer of Spikes by using Brave Bird, then Froslass should use Destiny Bond the first turn. They will be forced to either switch to save their Talonflame, or attack again and let it be KOed. By doing this, Froslass will either eliminate what is probably a large threat to your team or scare the Talonflame out and get hazards up.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Bisharp or Defiant Thundurus can discourage Defog after Froslass goes down. Prankster Thundurus is good on offensive teams in general to stop sweepers with Thunder Wave or sweep with Nasty Plot. Belly Drum Azumarill is a potent sweeper that also enjoys having its checks weakened by entry hazards. Either Mega Evolution of Charizard can force switches and fit well on offensive teams. Offensive teams usually also want Stealth Rock, so Pokemon that can set it up, such as Terrakion, Garchomp, Landorus, or Landorus-T, are good. Really, any good offensive Pokemon will fit on a team with Froslass and be able to take advantage of the Spikes.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>A bulkier set with Pain Split can be used to set up entry hazards throughout the match, but Froslass is still very frail. Thunderbolt is a decent option to get good coverage and hurt Pokemon like Skarmory, but Froslass doesn't want to give up any moveslots. Thunder Wave can cripple Pokemon. Hidden Power Fire 2HKOes Ferrothorn and Scizor, but is useless in most other situations.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie tank Ice Beam with ease and can bounce back any potential Spikes with their ability, Magic Bounce.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Although Froslass is quite fast, common Pokemon that outspeed it such as Thundurus will limit it to one layer of entry hazards. Many Choice Scarf users such as Excadrill will also do the job.</p>

<p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can knock Froslass down to its Focus Sash and finish it off with sandstorm damage.</p>

<p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Scizor can KO Froslass with Bullet Punch, limiting it to one layer of Spikes at most. Other priority users such as Talonflame and Azumarill are also effective.</p>

<p><strong>Rapid Spinners and Defoggers</strong>: These Pokemon can remove Froslass's entry hazards once it is gone, although Froslass does a good job of stopping these Pokemon while it's on the field with Taunt and its Ghost typing.</p>

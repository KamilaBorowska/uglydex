<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Weavile is a great revenge killer in OU due to its good Speed and Attack, further supplemented by the now legal combination of Knock Off and Icicle Crash. This allows Weavile to remove the opposing Pokemon's item while also having an Ice-type STAB far stronger than Ice Punch. Weavile also has access to priority Ice Shard, allowing it to finish off fast and frail offensive enemies. However, Weavile is very frail and is weak to Stealth Rock. Priority moves such as Mach Punch and Bullet Punch hit Weavile hard, especially given its 4x weakness to Fighting-type attacks.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Icicle Crash is now compatible with Knock Off and is Weavile's hardest hitting Ice-type STAB move; however, it only has 90% accuracy. Knock Off hits most Pokemon hard due to its heightened power if the opponent is holding an item. Ice Shard is priority for finishing off foes and helps with revenge killing frail and fast offensive Pokemon. Low Kick is to hit Rock-, Steel-, and Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Pursuit can finish Pokemon by preventing them from switching out before taking damage; it helps especially against Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Latios, Celebi, and Mew. Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy-type Pokemon, especially Azumarill, which doesn't mind taking a Knock Off, Low Kick, or Icicle Crash. Swords Dance raises Weavile's Attack by two stages and can be used when predicting switches so it Weavile can be used as a late-game sweeper.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Life Orb makes Weavile's attacks deal more damage at the cost of some health. The EV spread gives Weavile the most power and Speed needed for hitting hard and quick, a dire prerequisite due to its frailty. A Jolly nature lets Weavile outspeed other fast Pokemon such as Starmie, Latios, and Gengar.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Weavile is a hit-and-run Pokemon unless using Swords Dance, making it an effective revenge killer. The objective is to come in after a foe has fainted and either finish them or hit a Pokemon switching in hard before switching out. Knock Off hits most Pokemon hard and removes their item. Weavile is good at checking frail and fast Pokemon with its great Speed and Attack, and its Ice typing is good for checking multiple threats in the tier such as Garchomp, Dragonite, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias. However, Weavile shouldn't be staying in against Pokemon that threaten it; switch out and preserve it for later in the battle.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin users such as Starmie and Tentacruel help to effectively remove entry hazards, notably Stealth Rock, which Weavile is weak to. This helps Weavile safely switch in and out, supporting its role as a revenge killer. Defog users such as Latios, Zapdos, Gliscor, and Scizor can remove entry hazards without getting blocked; however, Weavile appreciates hazards on the opposing side, which is why teammates such as Garchomp, Terrakion, and Landorus are helpful for getting up Stealth Rock. Klefki gets a special mention because of Prankster, Spikes, and Thunder Wave that allow it to stack hazards and cripple fast enemies. Allies that appreciate Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon being removed such as Terrakion, Celebi, Latios, Latias, Scolipede, and Mega Venusaur are good partners for Weavile. Keldeo and Mega Charizard also appreciate Latios being removed, which Weavile can KO.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Choice Band can be used to deal more damage at the cost of locking Weavile into one move. Iron Tail deals more damage than Poison Jab against most Fairy-type Pokemon; unfortunately, it has poor accuracy and doesn't hit Azumarill super effectively, so it's generally not worth it. Ice Punch has more accuracy than Icicle Crash if Weavile doesn't want to risk the chance of missing at the cost of less power. However, this misses out on 2HKOing Chesnaught and other threats in the tier.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority attacks such as Mach Punch from Conkeldurr and Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor can OHKO Weavile before it has the chance to attack. Breloom can also check Weavile in an emergency; however, it takes 80% damage from Ice Shard.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune, Rotom-W, and Alomomola resist Icicle Crash and can cripple Weavile with a burn from Scald or Will-O-Wisp, wearing it down a bit each turn.</p>

<p><strong>Azumarill</strong>: Azumarill can come in against any of Weavile's attacks, if it isn't running Poison Jab, and use the opportunity to deal out a hard hit on the Pokemon switching in or get up a free Belly Drum. Weavile needs to be cautious when Azumarill is on the opposing side, making double switches when necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Keldeo</strong>: Keldeo resists both of Weavile's STAB attacks and threatens Weavile out with its Fighting-type STAB moves. On the turn that Weavile switches out, Keldeo can set up a Calm Mind or damage the incoming Pokemon.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mega Scizor can regain HP from Roost after switching in. Skarmory can use the chance to set up entry hazards or predict the switch, double switching into another Pokemon while Scizor can use the chance to Swords Dance.</p>

<p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Weavile is a revenge killer, meaning it is going to constantly switch in and out. If Stealth Rock is up, Weavile takes a ton of damage each time it switches in due to its Rock-type weakness.</p>

<p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion can check Weavile by taking an Ice Shard and otherwise outspeeding Weavile, and OHKOing it. When bringing Terrakion in against Weavile, it has the chance of its Choice Scarf getting removed by Knock Off and proceeding to get OHKOed by Low Kick</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Status can cripple Weavile's role as a revenge killer due to burn lowering its Attack, paralysis lowering Weavile's Speed, preventing it from outspeeding key threats, and poison wearing down Weavile after each turn, limiting the amount of times it can attack on top of Life Orb damage.</p>

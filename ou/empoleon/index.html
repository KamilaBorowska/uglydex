<h1>Tiers</h1>

</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>While Empoleon's UU status might leave it overlooked in OU, it actually has quite a notable niche in handling many prominent threats, such as Latios, Latias, Superpower-lacking Azumarill, and Clefable, all common roadblocks to many teams. Empoleon can also support its team with access to both Defog and Stealth Rock, and its typing and good natural bulk allow it to function effectively as a special wall. Empoleon's excellent movepool backed by a base 111 Special Attack also means that it can be used as a tank. However, its weaknesses to common offensive types such as Electric, Fighting, and Ground mean that it can be hard-pressed to switch in, and its lack of reliable recovery and low Speed mean that it can be easily worn down.</p>

<h1>Specially Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Empoleon @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Torrent<br>
    EVs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD<br>
    Calm Nature<br>
    - Scald<br>- Toxic<br>- Roar / Protect<br>- Stealth Rock / Defog
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Scald's 30% burn chance helps Empoleon handle physical attackers more easily and deters many of them from switching in. Toxic puts a timer on opponents, slowly wearing them down. Roar can be used to stop Pokemon such as Calm Mind Clefable from setting up for free, although Protect can be helpful for accumulating Leftovers recovery and racking up Toxic damage, as well as scouting for moves. Stealth Rock should be used if your team lacks an entry hazard setter. Defog can be used in this slot to clear hazards when facing Pokemon that cannot touch Empoleon.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EV spread allows Empoleon to make the best of its excellent Special Defense, which is further bolstered by a Calm nature. Leftovers gives Empoleon some much-needed passive recovery.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Empoleon works nicely as a pivot, switching into common threats such as Azumarill and Heatran. It can serve as a good answer to most rain teams, easily handling staples such as Azumarill without Superpower and Kabutops, while still handling many common threats such as Clefable. Stealth Rock and Defog can be used rather easily, as Empoleon forces quite a few switches, most notably on Heatran, one of the most common Stealth Rock users. Scald is a very spammable move, crippling many switch-ins and potentially whittling their health down for other teammates. Keep in mind that Empoleon has no access to reliable recovery, so keep it away from Knock Off and potential Will-O-Wisp users to let it do its job more effectively.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Wish support from teammates is very helpful, as Empoleon lacks any reliable recovery of its own. Landorus-T and Gliscor appreciate Empoleon's ability to deal with threats such as Azumarill, Substitute + Dragon Dance Gyarados, and other Water- and Ice-types which they cannot handle, and can take Fighting-, Electric-, and Ground-type moves in return. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Latios appreciate Empoleon's ability to switch into Azumarill and Heatran.</p>

<h1>Choice Specs</h1>

<div class=set>
    Empoleon @ Choice Specs<br>
    Ability: Torrent<br>
    EVs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 Spe<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Hydro Pump<br>- Flash Cannon<br>- Grass Knot<br>- Hidden Power Fire / Ice Beam
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>STAB Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump hits astonishingly hard coming off Empoleon's decent base 111 Special Attack, denting most Pokemon without a resistance. Flash Cannon is Empoleon's second STAB move, dispatching Fairy-types and 2HKOing Pokemon that resist Water such as the Lati twins. Grass Knot hits most opposing Water-types such as Keldeo, Suicune, and Azumarill. Hidden Power Fire takes care of Scizor and Ferrothorn, while Ice Beam can be used to defeat Dragon-types more easily.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>A standard spread for a special attacker allows Empoleon to hit as hard as possible while maintaining enough Speed to outrun Clefable, Azumarill, and minimum Speed Tyranitar. Alternatively, a Timid nature can be used to get the jump on neutral-natured Heatran, Breloom, and Scizor. Choice Specs boosts the power of Empoleon's attacks, and Torrent enables it to do even more damage to opponents while on the brink of fainting.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>The standard defensive set can easily be bluffed, allowing Empoleon to surprise the opponent with a powerful Choice Specs-boosted attack. Empoleon's STAB combination hits most of the tier neutrally, with Rotom-W and Chansey being the only common counters to it. This set is also a neat answer to Water-types in general, being able to easily switch into Choice-locked Keldeo and Azumarill, as well as bulkier Water-types such as Suicune and Slowbro.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Gliscor and Landorus-T have great synergy with Empoleon, resisting each other's weaknesses, and can act as offensive pivots to maintain momentum and keep applying offensive pressure. Healing Wish support from Latias is extremely helpful due to the fact that Latias also beats most of Empoleon's common checks, such as Mega Venusaur, Keldeo, and Rotom-W. Rotom-W and Chansey wall this set completely, so a teammate such as Mold Breaker Excadrill or Assault Vest Conkeldurr can patch up these problems. Talonflame also works decently as a teammate, as it can take care of Ferrothorn and most Fighting-types with ease, while Empoleon can switch into Heatran and Tyranitar in return.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Icy Wind, Yawn, and Knock Off can be used on the defensive set, but the given moves are generally more useful. A SubPetaya set can work decently, but there are still many Pokemon which can take a hit or outspeed and KO it. A physically based set with Defiant is usable, but Empoleon's lackluster physical movepool and low Speed leave it easily walled or revenge killed. Empoleon's low Speed can be somewhat remedied by using an Agility set, but such a set lacks power and can still be easily revenge killed.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Raikou, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus can often threaten out Empoleon with a powerful STAB move, although they don't enjoy switching into the Choice Specs set. Rotom-W in particular takes pitiful damage from both of Empoleon's sets, but a Scald burn can force Rotom-W to use up its Chesto Berry early.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Mega Heracross, and Terrakion scare off Empoleon with a super effective STAB move, but they cannot switch in directly due to the risk of a burn or heavy damage. However, Conkeldurr can easily switch into any move that Empoleon wants to use courtesy of its Assault Vest and recover off the damage while OHKOing Empoleon with Drain Punch. Conkeldurr also doesn't mind being burned due to Guts .</p>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Most Grass-types don't fear a burn from the defensive set due to them being specially oriented, although Ice Beam and Flash Cannon will deal a hefty chunk to them. Mega Venusaur in particular walls both sets, being immune to Toxic and having a neutrality to Ice Beam thanks to Thick Fat.</p>

<p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's insane special bulk allows it to eat up any attack from Empoleon and stall Empoleon out with a combination of Seismic Toss and Soft-Boiled. Chansey also doesn't fear a Scald burn due to Natural Cure.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Cobalion's niche in OU is being is a great Stealth Rock setter and Volt Switch user that is capable of dealing with Bisharp and Mega Gardevoir. Cobalion has a high Defense stat and access to attacks such as Stealth Rock and Volt Switch, allowing it to support its team and gain momentum. It's able to take hits due to its Steel / Fighting typing, which gives it eight resistances as well as an immunity to Poison-type attacks. However, Cobalion has mediocre offensive stats that make it difficult for it to dish out heavy amounts of damage and achieve KOs, so it rather easily handled by common Pokemon. Although Cobalion is only weak to Fighting-, Fire-, and Ground-type attacks, offensive moves of these types are common and thus still manage to cause massive problems for it.</p>

<h1>Offensive Pivot</h1>

<div class=set>
    Cobalion @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Justified<br>
    EVs: 140 HP / 112 Atk / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Close Combat<br>- Volt Switch<br>- Iron Head<br>- Taunt / Stealth Rock
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Close Combat is Cobalion's most powerful STAB attack and hits Pokemon such as Bisharp, Kyurem-B, and Tyranitar for super effective damage. Iron Head is a Steel-type STAB move that hits Fairy-types such as Clefable and Mega Gardevoir for super effective damage. Volt Switch allows Cobalion to gain momentum against several of its checks and counters by using it on the turn that they switch in. Taunt is great for crippling common switch-ins such as Mew and Skarmory and preventing Pokemon such as Landorus-T from setting up Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock is useful for damaging Pokemon as they switch in and can be used in the last slot if no other Pokemon on Cobalion's team has room to run it. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple Pokemon that don't mind switching in, such as Mega Charizard X. Hidden Power Ice is another option in the last slot to catch Gliscor and Landorus off-guard, as they don't mind taking an Iron Head or Close Combat.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The 140 HP EVs allow Cobalion to survive an Earthquake from Excadrill and take it out with Close Combat while the Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Mega Gardevoir with Iron Head and 2HKOs on Ferrothorn and specially defensive Heatran with Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers is chosen to keep Cobalion healthy as it switches into foes throughout the match. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD and a Jolly nature can be run, letting Cobalion tank a Focus Blast from Timid Mega Gardevoir while avoiding the 2HKO from Life Orb Latios's Hidden Power Fire most of the time.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Volt Switch should be used constantly to gain momentum, but be cautious of common Ground-type switch-ins such as Gliscor and Landorus-T, which don't fear Cobalion's attacks if it isn't running Hidden Power Ice; double switches expecting these Pokemon can prove effective. Use Stealth Rock when Pokemon such as Bisharp and Tyranitar are on the field, as they will likely switch out, not wanting to get OHKOed. Bringing in Cobalion on a predicted Dark-type attack can be useful to gain it an Attack boost via Justified and dish out more significant damage, but this can prove risky if the Dark-type attack user is not Bisharp. Cobalion can be unpredictable with Hidden Power Ice and Thunder Wave if you choose to run one of those options, so revealing them too early can throw away the element of surprise against opponents with Landorus, Gliscor, and Mega Charizard X.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Landorus-T is an excellent partner, as it's able to check Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, and Garchomp, which don't mind switching in on Cobalion. In return, Cobalion is able to remove Bisharp, which Landorus-T doesn't like switching in on due to Defiant; together, these Pokemon form a solid VoltTurn core. Mega Manectric is a great partner as well, being able to check Water-type Pokemon and forming a VoltTurn core with Landorus-T and Cobalion; however, keep in mind that you're stacking two not-so-strong VoltTurn Pokemon together, so Spikes to take advantage of the switches forced by using Volt Switch or other methods of stallbreaking are necessary. Latios keeps Water- and Fire-types in check, particularly Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y, and appreciates Cobalion's ability to check Pokemon such as Bisharp, Mega Gardevoir, and Tyranitar. Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mew and Slowbro also appreciate Cobalion for its ability to deal with Bisharp; Slowbro is also able to cover all of Cobalion's weaknesses by checking Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon and resisting Fighting-type attacks. Mega Latias is a good partner as Cobalion can check the Dark-types that get in its way.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Swords Dance with three attacks is a possibility, as Cobalion's Defense, Speed, and multiple resistances give it opportunities to set up and proceed to sweep. However, Cobalion still suffers from a lack of power and finds difficulty in setting up the multiple boosts that would be required for it to sweep. Stone Edge can be used to hit Pokemon such as Charizard and Talonflame super effectively.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-type Pokemon such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon don't mind switching in against Cobalion and can threaten it out with a STAB Earthquake. If they're predicting the switch, they can also use the chance to set up Stealth Rock; Hippowdon and Gliscor can also use Slack Off and Roost to heal themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro, Starmie, and Gastrodon can take Iron Head and Close Combat with ease, not to mention they all have access to recovery. Cobalion only has 72 Special Defense, so it doesn't appreciate being hit or crippled by a burn with Scald.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Chandelure can take Iron Head and Close Combat and retaliate with their STAB Fire-type attacks; however, they have to be wary if they don't know Cobalion's full set, as they do not like being hit by Stone Edge.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Heatran, Choice Scarf Keldeo, and Manectric can come in after a teammate has fainted and threaten Cobalion out with their hard-hitting attacks due to Cobalion's mediocre Special Defense. Choice Scarf Heatran can also catch Cobalion off guard if it's played correctly by faking the specially defensive set, as Cobalion will think Heatran is going to switch out.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Azumarill remains a potent threat in the OU metagame thanks to its fantastic traits such as its typing, bulk, power, and movepool. Its Water / Fairy typing gives it key resistances and immunities to Fire-, Dragon-, Fighting-, Water-, and Dark-type moves, which, when combined with its great 100 / 80 / 80 bulk, allows it to sponge many hits and gain free turns. Additionally, its ability, Huge Power, turns its terrible base 50 Attack stat into the equivalent of a base 150 Attack stat, ensuring that it's no pushover offensively. It also has a great movepool to compliment that. Access to priority in Aqua Jet, powerful STAB moves in Play Rough and Waterfall, and coverage in Knock Off and Superpower ensure that it will always have the right move for the job. These traits allow it to effectively run a Choice Band set, a Belly Drum Set, and an Assault Vest set, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. However, Azumarill has a very low base 50 Speed, which often forces it to take a hit before attacking, and it is walled by Steel-types unless it's running Superpower, which lowers its Attack and Defense after every use. Additionally, common Electric- and Grass-types, such as Raikou, Thundurus, and Mega Venusaur, are able to check Azumarill, meaning it struggles to do much before these Pokemon are sufficiently weakened.</p>

<h1>Choice Band</h1>

<div class=set>
    Azumarill @ Choice Band<br>
    Ability: Huge Power<br>
    EVs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Play Rough<br>- Waterfall<br>- Aqua Jet<br>- Superpower / Knock Off
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Play Rough and Waterfall are Azumarill's main STAB moves, and hit incredibly hard thanks to Choice Band. Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to revenge kill weakened threats and sweep late-game should the opportunity arise. The final slot is dependent on what the team needs. Superpower is useful for luring in Ferrothorn for a 2HKO while also hitting other Steel-types such as Magnezone and Skarmory after it uses Roost. However, Knock Off can be used instead for coverage against bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Mew while also having utility in removing items.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EV spread hits a Speed stat of 157, which allows Azumarill to outpace uninvested base 60 Speed Pokemon, such as Clefable and Sylveon. If outspeeding support Tyranitar is appealing, then 92 Speed EVs should be used. 164 Speed EVs outpace uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon, which includes bulky Bisharp and Skarmory. The Attack EVs should be maximized in every instance, however, as they ensure that Azumarill will hit as hard as possible. Choice Band is the item of choice to further boost its power.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Use this set to punch holes in opposing defensive cores to pave way for a teammate to sweep early-game. During the late-game, Azumarill acts as a great cleaner thanks to its powerful Aqua Jet. Additionally, Azumarill is a great check to many Dark-, Fighting-, and Dragon-types thanks to its excellent typing. This allows Azumarill to switch into prominent threats such as Latios, Keldeo, and Tyranitar.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that can take on Electric-types, such as Ferrothorn and specially defensive Heatran, make for good partners. Additionally, they have access to Stealth Rock, which helps wear down opposing teams. Pokemon that can take on the bulky Grass-types that wall Azumarill, such as Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir, also make Azumarill's job of nuking everything much easier. Lastly, Pokemon that capitalize on Azumarill's wallbreaking prowess make excellent teammates. Swords Dance Mega Gallade appreciates the removal of Mega Sableye, Swords Dance Garchomp appreciates the removal of bulky Ground-types, and Swords Dance Talonflame appreciates the removal of Rock-types and Heatran. Additionally, Nasty Plot Thundurus appreciates the removal of bulky Ground-types and Latias, and it also helps Azumarill by taking on bulky Water-types and Skarmory.</p>

<h1>Belly Drum</h1>

<div class=set>
    Azumarill @ Sitrus Berry<br>
    Ability: Huge Power<br>
    EVs: 92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Belly Drum<br>- Aqua Jet<br>- Play Rough<br>- Knock Off
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Belly Drum maximizes Azumarill's Attack at the cost of half its HP, which turns it into an immediate offensive threat. Aqua Jet is Azumarill's Water-type STAB move, as it hits insanely hard after a boost and has priority, which is often enough to sweep teams by itself. Should that not be sufficient, Play Rough is Azumarill's Fairy-type STAB move that hits slower Pokemon much harder, netting KOs Aqua Jet fails to achieve. The last slot is reserved for Knock Off, which hits everything that Play Rough and Aqua Jet can't. For example, Ferrothorn and Amoonguss, two otherwise solid Azumarill checks, are OHKOed after Stealth Rock by a +6 Knock Off.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EV spread, which allows Azumarill to hit 177 Speed, is optimized to outspeed uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon and below, which includes Skarmory, Tyranitar, and Clefable. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature are used to give Azumarill as much power as possible. The remaining EVs go into HP to give Azumarill a little bulk, and the HP number is even to ensure that its Sitrus Berry is activated after the Belly Drum. Sitrus Berry is the item of choice to give Azumarill HP back after using Belly Drum, which allows it to survive longer.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This set is best used late-game after threats have been weakened, as otherwise setting up will be a lost cause. Getting Azumarill in safely is critical, so bringing it in after one of its teammates has been KOed is advisable. Targets to set up on include Fighting-types as well as defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Hippowdon, and Gliscor, as they fail to deal significant damage to Azumarill. Alternatively, Azumarill does not need to set up every game. There are some situations where using Azumarill for its defensive capabilities is more beneficial, such as when the opponent has a threatening Dragon-, Fighting-, or Fairy-type. In this case, Azumarill makes for a good check because its Sitrus Berry gives it a slight form of recovery that better enables it to do its job.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Azumarill appreciates having its checks and counters removed so it can sweep. Strong Electric-types, such as Raikou, Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Thundurus help by taking on Skarmory, Talonflame, and bulky Water-types. Additionally, Magnezone is able to trap and KO Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory. Azumarill appreciates entry hazard support, so Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Swords Dance Garchomp, Air Balloon Heatran, and Landorus make for great partners, as they fit right in on the offensive teams Belly Drum Azumarill finds its home on. Additionally, Azumarill hates entry hazards on its side of the field, so Pokemon capable of removing them, such as Latios, Starmie, and Excadrill, make for good partners. Lastly, Mega Venusaur is a complete roadblock to Azumarill, so teammates that can KO it, such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Metagross, and Mega Gallade, are needed.</p>

<h1>Assault Vest</h1>

<div class=set>
    Azumarill @ Assault Vest<br>
    Ability: Huge Power<br>
    EVs: 240 HP / 252 Atk / 16 SpD<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Play Rough<br>- Waterfall<br>- Aqua Jet<br>- Knock Off / Superpower
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Play Rough and Waterfall are Azumarill's main STAB moves, as they sport good power and coverage. Aqua Jet gives Azumarill a good priority move to work with to help mitigate its low Speed. The fourth slot is a choice between two coverage moves. Knock Off is the preferred move, as it deals good damage and has the added benefit of removing items. Alternatively, Superpower can be used to get a large hit on Ferrothorn, although depending on Ferrothorn's spread, it may only be a 3HKO after the Attack drops.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment allow Azumarill to hit as hard as possible. 240 HP EVs give Azumarill great bulk while also ensuring that Seismic Toss fails to 4HKO. 16 EVs in Special Defense allow Azumarill to reach a Special Defense stat of 300 after the Assault Vest boost, which bolsters its role as an offensive tank. An alternative EV spread of 16 HP / 252 Atk / 240 SpD with an Adamant nature can be used to give Azumarill a lot more Special Defense, but Azumarill then loses out on overall bulk and fails to take physical hits as well.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This variant of Azumarill is used as an offensive tank capable of pivoting into many special attacks while also taking on physical attackers relatively well. This role allows it to work best on bulky offense and balance teams, and it pairs well with Steel- and Dragon-types thanks to their great type synergy. It is also capable of beating most special attackers 1v1, including those that hit it super effectively, such as Thundurus and Gengar. Additionally, Azumarill is a great revenge killer with Aqua Jet and is capable of taking out many weakened Pokemon. Azumarill is also a great spammer of Knock Off, as many of its switch-ins do not appreciate losing their items.</p>

<h2>Team options</h2>

<p>Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Latios, and Latias take on the Electric- and Grass-types that threaten Azumarill. Ferrothorn and Heatran appreciate Azumarill's ability to take on Fighting- and Ground-types that threaten them, and in return they are able to take on Pokemon such as Thundurus, as well as set up entry hazards. Pokemon that threaten the bulky Steel-types that wall Azumarill make for great partners. Heatran, Talonflame, Magnezone, and Mega Charizard X fit this role well.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Azumarill can fit on stall teams if it runs a defensive set with Sap Sipper. However, it lacks reliable recovery and has very little offensive presence without Huge Power. Additionally, Facade can be run on the Choice Band set so Azumarill can still function while burned.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Tentacruel resist both of Azumarill's STAB moves and take very little from its coverage moves. Additionally, they are able to hit Azumarill super effectively with their STAB attacks. However, both Amoonguss and Tentacruel can potentially lose to the Belly Drum set if weakened enough, although Mega Venusaur doesn't have this problem.</p>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Magnezone, Skarmory, bulky Mega Scizor, and Mega Metagross are all able to check or counter Azumarill reliably, as they all resist Play Rough. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor all take little from Waterfall and can use Azumarill as setup bait and set up Spikes, or Swords Dance in the latter's case. Mega Metagross and Magnezone threaten to OHKO with their STAB attacks after minimal prior damage, and they also have the bulk to take an Aqua Jet.</p>

<p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Mega Scizor, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Quagsire, Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, Mega Venusaur, Mew, Clefable, and Rotom-W all check or counter Azumarill reliably thanks to their great physical bulk. Mega Scizor is able to set up Swords Dances on non-Choice Band variants and Roost off any damage it may take. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can set up entry hazards, and in the latter's case, Leech Seed. Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, and Quagsire can Recover stall non-Choice Band variants and burn them with Scald. Rotom-W can burn Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp, or Volt Switch out to maintain momentum. Mew and Cresselia are able to stomach a Knock Off and can cripple Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, respectively. Mega Venusaur is the ultimate Azumarill counter, as it takes less than 40% from any of its attacks and can hit back super effectively and heal with Giga Drain. Finally, physically defensive Clefable is able to counter Azumarill depending on its set. Unaware Clefable counters both the Assault Vest and Belly Drum sets, while Magic Guard Clefable can only take on the Assault Vest set.</p>

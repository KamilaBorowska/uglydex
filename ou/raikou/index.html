<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Boasting high Speed, good Special Attack, and a key Electric typing, Raikou finds a niche in XY OU as a check to top-tier threats such as Thundurus, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir. Choice Specs Raikou can fire off very powerful attacks that are difficult to switch into. With the aid of an Assault Vest, it can check even the likes of Gengar and pivot with Volt Switch, functioning as a nice glue Pokemon for offensive teams weak to these specific threats. Raikou can also function as a devastating Calm Mind sweeper against unprepared teams and has decent coverage that makes it far from one-dimensional. Poor physical bulk, generally unimpressive power without a boost, and being easily handled by special walls hold it back significantly, but Raikou still manages to shine in a tier dominated by powerful Flying- and Electric-types.</p>

<h1>Choice Specs</h1>

<div class=set>
    Raikou @ Choice Specs<br>

    EVs: 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Thunderbolt<br>- Volt Switch<br>- Hidden Power Ice<br>- Shadow Ball / Extrasensory
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Thunderbolt provides a strong, reliable STAB option. Volt Switch is decently powerful with a Choice Specs boost and moreover provides Raikou with a cost-free move that lets it pivot out of unfavorable matchups. Hidden Power Ice hits crucial Ground- and Dragon-types for super effective damage, especially Landorus, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, and any Hippowdon without more than the standard 140 Special Defense EVs. Shadow Ball is good for a heavier hit on Latios, taking off upwards of three-quarters of its HP, and it also takes away almost half of Excadrill's health, changing it from a safe switch-in into something that can only switch in once. Extrasensory covers Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, which can otherwise handle this set well.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The Special Attack and Speed EVs enable Raikou to outrun Thundurus whilst hitting as hard as possible. The rest is dumped into HP for a bit of extra bulk.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Volt Switch is generally the spam move of choice, dealing moderate damage and providing a safeguard against poor matchups. Against Ground-type foes, it's typically best to hard switch into a better matchup on the predicted switch so that you don't lose momentum. Thunderbolt should be used to clean and for extra power if it is needed to obtain a KO. Like all Raikou variants, you'll want to be careful switching it in, as Raikou is prone to being worn down by entry hazards and even resisted attacks. If the foe has a Pokemon such as Thundurus, Mega Pinsir, or Talonflame, you'll want to make sure Raikou isn't brought down to such a range where they can break through it.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>This Raikou finds itself at home on offensive teams with VoltTurn cores. Pokemon such as Mega Scizor can form such cores; Mega Scizor specifically can pressure Chansey with Knock Off and generally threaten it, which is necessary for Raikou to break through defensive teams. Defog or spin support is essential to keep it in tip-top shape to handle threats; Skarmory and Mandibuzz can handle threatening Ground-types well and fill this role. Kyurem-B, Keldeo, and Manaphy are options to take care of Ground-types, too.</p>

<h1>Assault Vest</h1>

<div class=set>
    Raikou @ Assault Vest<br>

    EVs: 252 SpA / 32 SpD / 224 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Thunderbolt<br>- Volt Switch<br>- Hidden Power Ice<br>- Shadow Ball / Extrasensory
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Thunderbolt is Raikou's reliable STAB; it has the highest damage output and poses a great threat to Water-types and Mega Charizard Y, which Raikou is generally supposed to check. Volt Switch gives it a safe move to pivot and wear down defensive threats with, which works especially well in conjunction with entry hazards. Hidden Power Ice is compulsory coverage to hit Landorus, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, which otherwise completely wall Raikou. The last slot boils down to whether 2HKOing Latios (Shadow Ball) or actually threatening Mega Venusaur (Extrasensory) is preferred.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EVs provide enough Speed to outrun Thundurus and give Raikou a good enough damage output, with the rest in Special Defense to get a bit more special bulk out of the Assault Vest. Maximum Speed can be run to tie with Starmie, but it isn't common enough to be worth sacrificing bulk that comes in handy against threats such as Gengar.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Be wary of switching in and out a lot with this Raikou, as it will be worn down quickly. When in doubt, unless the opponent has a bulky Ground-type to switch in, Volt Switching out is the best option unless you absolutely have to stay in and attack. This keeps the momentum of the battle in your favor. If the opponent has a bulky Ground-type to switch in, just hard switch out anticipating the play.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mandibuzz that can handle Ground-types and physical attackers in general are useful teammates. Entry hazards limit this Raikou's longevity immensely due to its lack of Leftovers, so Defog or Rapid Spin support is heavily appreciated. It fits well into VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Scizor and Landorus-T.</p>

<h1>Calm Mind</h1>

<div class=set>
    Raikou @ Leftovers / Life Orb<br>

    EVs: 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Calm Mind<br>- Thunderbolt<br>- Hidden Power Ice<br>- Extrasensory / Substitute
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Calm Mind boosts Raikou's Special Attack, allowing it to function as an effective boosting sweeper. Thunderbolt is the main STAB attack, providing the most power against neutral targets. Hidden Power Ice covers most Ground- and Dragon-types, which would otherwise wall Raikou. Extrasensory gives important coverage to hit Mega Venusaur and Assault Vest Conkeldurr. If Raikou's teammates can handle Mega Venusaur adequately, then Substitute is an option to protect it from status and revenge killers. Volt Switch is another option, allowing Raikou to pivot around and have general use throughout the match; however, it is prone to being worn down and thus might have trouble sweeping, and it becomes hard to justify this over an Assault Vest or Choice Specs variant.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The Special Attack and Speed EVs enable Raikou to outrun Thundurus whilst hitting as hard as possible. The rest is dumped into HP for a small amount of extra bulk. Leftovers is useful to keep Raikou healthy so it can stay healthy whilst setting up and completing its sweep. Life Orb is also an option for some more power; for example, +1 Life Orb-boosted Extrasensory does roughly 80% to Mega Venusaur.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This Raikou can set up on Thundurus, one of the largest threats in OU, so setting up shouldn't be too difficult. Naturally, don't set up until Raikou's counters have been removed; until it can sweep, switching in at all should generally be avoided. Furthermore, don't be too greedy with boosts and let Raikou get worn down into a range where it can be revenge killed by priority.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon to take out pesky Excadrill, Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Choice Scarf Garchomp are heavily appreciated. Offensive Water-types, such as Keldeo and Manaphy, are standout options. Eliminating Chansey is also necessary; the aforementioned Keldeo as well as lures such as Knock Off Landorus fit this role nicely. If Substitute is chosen, then Pokemon to take out Mega Venusaur are mandatory; Landorus and Mega Charizard X are both adept at this task.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Aura Sphere would be a great option on Raikou, allowing it to smack threats such as Tyranitar and Mamoswine where it hurts, but it is event-locked to a Rash nature, which restricts it to Choice Scarf sets lest Raikou be outsped by many popular threats, including Keldeo, Latios, and Thundurus. Its movepool is rather shallow, so there isn't much else it can really do.</p>

<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mamoswine, Excadrill, Hippowdon, and Quagsire are all stellar answers to Raikou, as they take a pittance from its attacks and threaten it with their STAB Ground-type attacks. Choice Scarf Garchomp and Landorus-T are 4x weak to Ice, but can outspeed and OHKO it.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Attackers Neutral to Thunderbolt</strong>: Raikou's disappointing physical bulk means hard-hitting physical attackers, such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, can handle it easily.</p>

<p><strong>Special walls</strong>: Unaware Clefable stops Calm Mind Raikou dead in its tracks. Additionally, Sylveon, Chansey, and Mega Venusaur (if Raikou lacks Extrasensory) can handle it sufficiently.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards and Status</strong>: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic, and burn severely limit Raikou's longevity and general ability to last throughout the battle.</p>

<p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Both aren't really threatened too much by Raikou in general besides Shadow Ball, and they're able to switch in on most of its attacks and eliminate it with a Life Orb-boosted Psyshock no matter the set.</p>

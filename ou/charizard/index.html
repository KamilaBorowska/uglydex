<h1>Overview</h1>

<p><strong>Mega Charizard X</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Charizard X is arguably the best Dragon Dance user in the game at the moment.</li>
<li>Has great bulk and isn't 4x weak to Stealth Rock when Mega Evolved.</li>
<li>Tough Claws will boost all of its main STAB attacks.</li>
<li>Only Dragon Dance sweeper that isn't affected by burn.</li>
<li>Can run a pure offensive set and a Bulkier Dragon Dance set.</li>
<li>Good coverage movepool to abuse Dragon Dance.</li>
<li>Outsped by common scarfers at +1.</li>
<li>Can lose a lot of HP trying to breakthrough teams with Flare Blitz</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mega Charizard Y</strong>:</p>

<p>After many years of mediocrity, Charizard has risen to top of the food chain in the OU tier after receiving two Mega Evolutions. Mega Charizard Y is easily the most powerful wallbreaker under the sun. While the sun is up, it is countered by very few Pokemon, such as Latias, Latios, Chansey, Multiscale Dragonite, and its counterpart, Mega Charizard X. Despite its powerful Mega Evolution, Charizard's Fire / Flying typing does not change and makes it very weak to Stealth Rock. Additionally, its average Speed prevents it from sweeping teams.</p>

<h1>Dragon Dance</h1>

<div class=set>
    Charizard @ Charizardite X<br>
    Ability: Blaze<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br>
    Adamant / Jolly Nature<br>
    - Dragon Dance<br>- Flare Blitz / Fire Punch<br>- Dragon Claw / Outrage<br>- Earthquake / Roost
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dragon Dance turns him into a terrifying sweeper after one Dragon Dance.</li>
<li>Flare Blitz will nuke just about every physically defensive Pokemon that will switch in. However, you should be wary of the recoil from hitting Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Flare blitz tends to be better for wallbreaking purposes rather than sweeping.</li>
<li>Fire Punch is an option over Flare Blitz. It is weaker but you won't have a great need for Roost and it tends to be better for late game sweeping where you don't want to deal with massive Flare Blitz recoil that will cut your sweep short.</li>
<li>Dragon Claw is your secondary STAB moves to hit anything that isn't a Steel- or Fairy-type without locking yourself into Outrage.</li>
<li>Outrage is much more powerful option than Dragon Claw, however locking yourself into Outrage with Steel- or Fairy-types around you leave yourself open to being set up on.</li>
<li>Roost is the preferred option for longevity and works really well in conjunction with Flare Blitz.</li>
<li>Earthquake is useful to beat Heatran who otherwise walls you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<ul>
<li>EVs are meant to maximize sweeping effectiveness.</li>
<li>Adamant gives you a little more power at the cost of losing some speed.</li>
<li>Choosing Jolly over Adamant will outspeed Scarf Landorus-T at +1 but at the loss of some power.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Late game sweeper once checks / counters are cleared and weakened.</li>
<li>Can be used as a wallbreaker for other physical sweeper such as Terrakion and Lucario.</li>
<li>Stealth Rock support is crucial for Charizard to succeed.</li>
<li>Generally you should try to set up on something like Skarmory who can't really handle either Charizard X or Y and will likely switch out allowing you to set up a Dragon Dance.</li>
<li>Will-O-Wisp user don't generally pose much of an issue as you can't be burnt and can be used as set up fodder if played correctly.</li>
<li>Can setup on Scald users without fearing the burn.</li>
<li>Getting Charizard in before SR is up is important. Predicting the Stealth Rock user to go for SR is one way of accomplishing this.</li>
<li>Switching Charizard in on slow and more defensive mons such Jellicent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sticky Web support to slow down grounded Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Garchomp.</li>
<li>Defog user or Spinner to keep it healthy such as Mew, Latias, Latios, Starmie, and Excadrill.</li>
<li>Gothitelle can trap Quagsire, Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Skarmory (if lacking a Fire-type move).</li>
<li>Terrakion, Diggersby, and Dragonite can break down the same threats that pose issues to Charizard X and open up a sweep for either one.</li>
<li>Dugtrio can trap and beat Heatran.</li>
<li>Clefable is a great teammates for its cleric capabilities that will cure Charizard of poison and paralysis.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Drought Wallbreaker</h1>

<div class=set>
    Charizard @ Charizardite Y<br>
    Ability: Blaze<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid / Modest Nature<br>
    - Fire Blast<br>- Solar Beam<br>- Focus Blast<br>- Roost / Dragon Pulse
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>In the sun, Fire Blast 2HKOes, if not totally incinerates, just about anything that doesn't resist or absorb it save for a small number of special walls. A neutral Fire Blast also hits much harder than Charizard-Y's other attacks hitting super effectively, so the other moves listed should only really be used situationally. If accuracy worries you, Flamethrower can be used for consistency, but the power loss is very noticeable.</p>

<p>Solar Beam allows Charizard-Y to hit the Water- and Rock-types that resist Fire Blast, but it must be used while the sunlight is shining. Focus Blast gives Charizard-Y much needed coverage against Heatran and Tyranitar, both of which limit the use of Fire Blast and Solar Beam. Roost provides a great means of recovery, granting Charizard-Y longevity and going well in tandem with its high Special Defense. On the other hand, Dragon Pulse gives it coverage against Dragon-types, allowing Charizard-Y a chance to win against Dragonite, Charizard-X, Latios, and Goodra.</p>

<p>Earthquake can be used over Focus Blast to beat Heatran more reliably than Focus Blast would. However, this does make dealing with Tyranitar a little tougher, as 4 Atk Charizard-Y only 3HKOes it with Earthquake.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>This set is a simple special attacker, so maximized Special Attack and Speed are required to make it as fast and powerful as possible. A Timid nature is preferred to avoid being outsped by several key threats, especially positive-natured threats in the base 87-100 Speed range such as Excadrill, Mega Garchomp, Landorus-T, Kyurem-B, and Mega Charizard X. Mega Charizard Y also gains so much power in the sunlight that it doesn't really need the extra strength offered by Modest, though it can be used if your team can handle the Pokemon previously mentioned. Although Charizard should Mega Evolve immediately anyways, Blaze should be used instead of Solar Power as this set's default ability to avoid taking damage in sunlight. </p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>The purpose of this set is essentially to destroy anything that it comes by. It can operate in nearly any part of the game, but shines especially well mid- to late-game, where it can wallbreak or clean up the opposing team as required. If possible, keep Mega Charizard Y alive until its most important targets have been eliminated, as it is an extremely valuable nuke that typically shouldn't faint so soon in the game.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it's not too hard to maintain Mega Charizard Y thanks to its decent defensive typing and great special bulk. Because of these traits, it can switch into common attacks, such as Earthquake, Knock Off, Iron Head, Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, Scald, Lava Plume, Moonblast, and other miscellaneous weak special attacks with ease. Another small but notable detail is that it can stomach some strong special attacks at full health; for instance, Life Orb Latias's Draco Meteor can only do 73.1 â€“ 86.2%, allowing Mega Charizard Y to recover with Roost while stalling Latias out thanks to Draco Meteor's special attack drop. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for strong physical attacks, so it is not advised to recklessly switch into these types of moves unless resisted.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Mega Charizard Y has a nasty Stealth Rock weakness, which can be taken care of with Defog or Rapid Spin support. Latias, Latios, Excadrill, Starmie, and Mew are good teammates that can clear away entry hazards safely and quickly; the former four are also notable for their good offensive power and coverage. Mega Charizard Y also appreciates defensive support, as it ideally wants to switch in multiple times while avoiding Rock- and Electric-type attacks. Hippowdon and Chesnaught are bulky walls that can absorb Thunderbolts and Stone Edges while also providing entry hazard support. More offensive teammates that can take these attacks include Assault Vest Raikou, Excadrill, and Landorus-T. Pairing it with a Pursuit trapper such as Tyranitar or Bisharp will greatly benefit Charizard and help it succeed in breaking down the opposing team with sun-boosted Fire Blasts. This deals with the Lati twins, and in the case of Bisharp, puts more pressure on Chansey.</p>

<p>Additionally, while this set breaks through a ton of defensive Pokemon, it notably has trouble dealing with Chansey and Blissey, both of which have more than enough Special Defense to switch into Fire Blast and heal off the damage repeatedly. Therefore, teammates that can beat them are absolutely required. Gothitelle is a fantastic partner for this, as it doesn't care much about incoming Toxics or Thunder Waves and can use Trick and Psyshock to completely dismantle the two pink blobs. More offensive alternatives for this role include Terrakion, Bisharp, Choice Band Tyranitar, Thundurus (with Knock Off and Superpower), Scizor, and Keldeo. Offensive support against opposing Latios and Latias (as well as other Dragon-types in general) is also appreciated; again, Tyranitar and Bisharp are good teammates, especially since they have access to Pursuit. The latter can also use its ability, Defiant, to punish both if they attempt to use Defog.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that Mega Charizard Y is skilled at wallbreaking. Take advantage of this by pairing Charizard with other offensive Pokemon that can clean up late-game. Good candidates for this include Keldeo, Talonflame, Kyurem-B, and many others, depending on your team.</p>

<ul>
<li>Earthquake beats Heatran who would otherwise wall Mega Charizard X.</li>
<li>Fire Punch is a good option if Heatran is handled by teammates.</li>
<li>Roost for longevity.</li>
<li>Dragon Claw is your main STAB move that doesn't lock you into an attack that can be taken advantage of.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<li>With the bulk investment, Charizard can set up on Rotom-W, Greninja, Mega Manectric and more, being able to take any hit as you Dragon Dance and Roost off the damage.</li>
<li>Late game sweeper once checks / counters are cleared and weakened.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>Defog user or Spinner to keep it healthy such as Mew, Latias, Latios, Starmie, and Excadrill.</li>
<li>Terrakion, Diggersby, and Dragonite can break down the same threats that pose issues to Mega Charizard X and opens up a sweep for either one.</li>

<h1>Bulky Will-O-Wisp</h1>

<div class=set>
    Charizard @ Charizardite X<br>
    Ability: Blaze<br>
    EVs: 248 HP / 148 SpD / 112 Spe<br>
    Careful Nature<br>
    - Earthquake / Fire Punch<br>- Dragon Claw<br>- Will-O-Wisp<br>- Roost
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<ul>
<li>Earthquake beats Heatran which is otherwise troublesome to this set.</li>
<li>Fire Punch takes out things like Lucario before they are able to take you out with an attack.</li>
<li>Dragon Claw is your main STAB option.</li>
<li>Will-O-Wisp can burn common switch-ins like Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon.</li>
<li>Roost for longevity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<ul>
<li>The 248 HP EVs give you an odd HP number meaning you take a a little less from Stealth Rock, giving you more chances to switch in while Stealth Rock is up.</li>
<li>112 Spd outspeeds Adamant Gyarados, letting you burn it before it uses Earthquake.</li>
<li>The remaining 148 EVs are placed into Special Defense to take Rotom-W's attacks a little better. These EVs can also be placed in Defense depending on the team.</li>
<li>Alternatively running 16 Spd EVs is enough to outpace Adamant Bisharp and gives you more bulk in the defense of you choice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>This set plays more as a pivot switch rather than a sweeper.</li>
<li>Able to tank some hits, spread burns, and break down the opposing team with Earthquake and Dragon Claw.</li>
<li>Lures in its physically defensive counters and wears them down with status, while wearing them down with attacks for another pokemon to sweep.</li>
<li>Sets up sweeps for Dragon Dancers like Dragonite by removing certain walls</li>
</ul>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>Excadrill and Forretress make good teammates as they are able to spin away rocks.</li>
<li>Defog users like Latios, Latias, and Mew are good teammates.</li>
<li>Dragonite and Garchomp appreciate having physical walls weakened and burned.</li>
<li>Landorus-T and Hippowdon are good teammates to cover for its weakness to Rocks and checking Terrakion.</li>
<li>Rotom-W is a good teammate as it can beat bulky Water-types and Ground-types. It also checks many of the Pokemon that Charizard can't beat on his own.</li>
<li>Thundurus can paralyze Choice Scarf users, such as Latios or Keldeo, that give Charizard some problems.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p><strong>Mega Charizard X</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Swords Dance is a cool option to use to destroy slower bulkier teams by beating its normal checks and counters. However this tends to be significantly worse then its other set and will not be useful against faster offensive teams.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mega Charizard Y</strong>:</p>

<p>Mega Charizard Y's overlooked base 104 Attack, with the help of Drought, makes its physical Fire-type attacks surprisingly strong. With maximized Attack, it can lure in and break through an astounding number of Pokemon that would have walled or stalled it out otherwise; Chansey, Blissey, specially defensive Clefable, Sylveon, and Assault Vest Conkeldurr are all 2HKOed by an accurate sun-boosted Flare Blitz (the latter four are OHKOed with just an entry hazard or two), while Heatran is OHKOed by Earthquake with no questions asked. However, it faces fierce competition from Mega Charizard X, as the latter has overall better typing and slightly higher damage output on its contact moves thanks to Tough Claws. While Mega Charizard X does outclass Mega Charizard Y in terms of physical attacking, Mega Charizard Y has the benefit of surprise value since it is normally seen using special sets, thus having a higher chance of luring the above threats in. If the above sounds appealing, it is perhaps best to use Flare Blitz and Earthquake on a mixed set, where it can use Solar Beam, Focus Blast, and Roost to get past its usual targets while still breaking through its new ones. Dragon Dance can also be used to boost physical moves, though again, Mega Charizard X tends to perform this better due to its superior typing and STAB moves.</p>

<p>Mega Charizard Y also has other special moves worth considering. Air Slash might seem like a good option, but its low Base Power and redundant coverage make it less appealing. Aside from a more accurate attack to use on Mega Venusaur and Conkeldurr (both of which are hit harder by sun-boosted Fire Blast anyway), it does not hit anything else notable and causes you to lose valuable coverage. Ancient Power is an option to OHKO Talonflame and opposing Mega Charizard Y, as well as reliably 2HKO Mega Charizard X and other miscellaneous Fire-types, but outside of these targets, it is rather weak. Overheat can also be used instead of or alongside Fire Blast to hit targets even harder, although the Special Attack drop will most likely force Mega Charizard Y out after its use.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Mega Charizard X</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heatran (if lacking Earthquake)</li>
<li>Hippowdon</li>
<li>Quagsire</li>
<li>Mandibuzz</li>
<li>Landorus-T</li>
<li>Slowbro</li>
<li>Azumarill</li>
<li>Talonflame</li>
<li>Choice scarf users like Garchomp, Terrakion, and Latios</li>
<li>Status: Poison and Paralysis makes sweeping harder: Slowbro, Klefki, Gliscor, and Thundurus</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mega Charizard Y</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Specially Defensive Tanks and Walls</strong>: Only a few select specially defensive Pokemon can switch into Charizard and live to tell the tale. Blissey and Chansey wall Mega Charizard Y hard and can heal back the damage while stalling it out with Seismic Toss and/or Toxic. Assault Vest Goodra and Snorlax are also notable for taking a pittance from even its super effective moves and can attack back with hard-hitting moves. However, they lack reliable recovery, meaning that they can be worn down easily by Mega Charizard Y's attacks. When sandstorm is up, Tyranitar and Hippowdon lower the power of Solar Beam and Fire Blast, and can use Solar Beam's charge-up turn as an opportunity to OHKO Mega Charizard Y with Rock Slide or Stone Edge. Politoed can also do this, except it summons rain instead of sandstorm, which further decreases the power of Fire Blast.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Fire-types</strong>: Without Earthquake or Ancient Power, Mega Charizard Y lacks good coverage against Fire-type Pokemon. However, with the help of Drought, it can manage to 2HKO frailer ones, so opponents must rely on bulkier choices. Moltres and specially defensive Talonflame can both take Mega Charizard Y's typical attacks very easily and wear it down with Toxic and Brave Bird respectively. Mega Charizard X also hard walls any set without Dragon Pulse and can proceed to set up or hit it hard with its powerful Dragon-type attacks. Entei risks being 2HKOed by Fire Blast or Focus Blast, but it can tank one of these attacks and respond back with Stone Edge or Extreme Speed.</p>

<p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Even if it carries Dragon Pulse, Mega Charizard Y may find itself at the mercy of several Dragon-type Pokemon. Latios, Latias, and Garchomp are all faster than Mega Charizard Y, and can tank at least one Dragon Pulse or Fire Blast before hitting back with a powerful attack of their own. Goodra is similar, but is slower and has so much special bulk that Dragon Pulse can only 3HKO it, with or without an Assault Vest. Dragonite can also tank Mega Charizard Y's attacks thanks to Multiscale and proceed to set up.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Mega Charizard Y's Speed is rather average, leaving it vulnerable to revenge killing. Thundurus, Terrakion, Greninja, Keldeo, Garchomp, and many others all threaten with super effective moves while outspeeding naturally. Threats with a Choice Scarf, such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, Diggersby, Gardevoir, and Tyranitar can also surprise and revenge kill it.</p>

<p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Even though it's not a direct counter, Stealth Rock can greatly limit Charizard's longevity.</p>

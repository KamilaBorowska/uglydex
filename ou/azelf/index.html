<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Azelf has all the required tools to make an excellent lead in the OU metagame. Its access to Stealth Rock as well as its fast base 115 Speed all but guarantee it can set up a layer of entry hazards for its team. A powerful Fire Blast is very useful in defeating common entry hazard removers, such as Excadrill. Explosion puts a dent in nearly everything and prevents a Defogger or spinner from removing Azelf's entry hazards or dual screens in the same turn. Combine all of the aforementioned qualities with Taunt and Skill Swap to cripple opposing entry hazard leads and Magic Bounce users, and Azelf will give your team early-game momentum easily. Alternatively, Azelf can utilize its access to Reflect and Light Screen to become a solid dual screens setter in the mid-game. On the downside, Azelf is frail, so it relies on a Focus Sash to survive super effective and even some neutral attacks. Its Psychic typing alongside its poor Defense leaves Azelf prone to Pursuit trapping and vulnerable to Knock Off and Sucker Punch. Once Azelf has been brought down to its Focus Sash, it is prone to being picked off by Choice Scarf holders and priority attackers. As Azelf typically just sets up Stealth Rock or dual screens and then faints, its work can go to waste if the opponent has a Defogger on their team. Azelf is also extremely predictable because it will almost always be leading, meaning that it is easy for the opponent to recognize this and send out an anti-lead. Nonetheless, Azelf is a great choice for any offensive team that desires momentum in the early- and mid-game.</p>

<h1>Dedicated Lead</h1>

<div class=set>
    Azelf @ Focus Sash<br>

    EVs: 196 Atk / 60 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Naive Nature<br>
    - Stealth Rock<br>- Explosion<br>- Fire Blast / Skill Swap<br>- Taunt
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Azelf's objective is to set up Stealth Rock quickly, which it can do easily because of its high Speed. Explosion deals an insane amount of damage even on a resisted hit and prevents foes from removing entry hazards on the turn Explosion is used. Fire Blast hits common checks to Azelf, such as Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Bisharp, for significant damage. Skill Swap can be used instead to steal Magic Bounce from Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, allowing Azelf to not have to worry about its Stealth Rock bouncing back. Taunt allows Azelf to shut down slower entry hazard leads and users of status moves in general.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>60 Special Attack EVs are necessary to always OHKO Bisharp with Fire Blast. The remaining EVs go into Attack and Speed to raise the power of Explosion and to maximize Azelf's ability to maintain momentum with Stealth Rock. A Naive nature is necessary to maximize Azelf's Speed while not cutting into either of its offensive stats and to allow Azelf to take priority hits such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet slightly better than it would with a Hasty nature. Focus Sash is critical due to the suicide nature of the set, as it guarantees that Azelf will survive a single powerful attack. If not running Fire Blast, use a Jolly nature with an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that Azelf will almost always be using Stealth Rock and then Explosion directly after. However, if the foe does not threaten Azelf offensively, feel free to use Taunt should Azelf be running the move. Because Azelf is a very obvious choice as a lead, don't lead with it if the opponent has a reliable answer to it, such as Bisharp for non-Fire Blast variants. If facing a Pokemon that can use Azelf as setup bait, Taunt it. However, not many Pokemon can reliably set up on Azelf due to the threat of Explosion. Prediction is key if you are running Skill Swap, as the opponent can decide whether or not to Mega Evolve their Diancie or Sableye right away.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Azelf finds a home on many hyper offense teams that appreciate its Stealth Rock support. Sweepers such as Keldeo and Landorus enjoy having their foes softened a bit, thus allowing them to land crucial KOs that they would not achieve without Stealth Rock damage. Bisharp can help keep Stealth Rock on the opponent's side of the field because it threatens users of Defog as well as Starmie. Support from Bisharp is especially critical if Azelf is not running Knock Off, as otherwise Starmie, Latios, and Latias will waste all of Azelf's work.</p>

<h1>Dual Screens</h1>

<div class=set>
    Azelf @ Light Clay<br>

    EVs: 176 HP / 80 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Light Screen<br>- Reflect<br>- Taunt / Stealth Rock<br>- Explosion / Stealth Rock
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Reflect and Light Screen are great supporting moves for offensive Pokemon, affording them extra bulk in order to make it easier for them to set up and sweep. Taunt's primary use is to cripple Defog users, though it also helps Azelf deal with entry hazard setters, slower Taunt users, and setup sweepers. Alternatively, Stealth Rock allows Azelf to further support its teammates by laying down an entry hazard. This helps to differentiate it from other dual screens setters, such as Latias and Latios. Explosion deals huge damage to anything that doesn't resist it, prevents a Defogger from removing Azelf's screens in the same turn, and prevents Azelf from becoming Taunt bait.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature allow Azelf to Speed tie with Starmie and opposing Azelf. The remaining EVs are used in the most efficient way to maximize Azelf's bulk and allow it to always survive a Brave Bird from Talonflame before Azelf can set up Reflect. Light Clay maximizes the duration of Light Screen and Reflect.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Though this set works well as a lead, it is preferred to use Azelf in the mid-game to help your win condition obtain free turns to set up because Azelf is a very obvious lead. Use Taunt to prevent defensive foes from stalling out the turns that the dual screens are up. If facing a mixed attacker, set up Stealth Rock instead of one of the screens, as you cannot afford to mispredict with Azelf.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Azelf does not need a lot of support; instead, you need teammates that it can support with its use of dual screens. Offensive Pokemon that appreciate dual screens include Nasty Plot Thundurus and Calm Mind Mega Gardevoir, as they are not bulky enough to sweep without them. A Pokemon that threatens priority users can help prolong Azelf's longevity and allow it to set up screens multiple times. Heatran is a great choice because it resists Talonflame's Brave Bird, while Mega Altaria can take Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Likewise, a priority attacker will threaten Choice Scarf users, such as Terrakion, that outspeed and threaten Azelf. Support from Bisharp can discourage Defog users such as Latias from removing Azelf's dual screens.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Azelf's high Speed makes it a good user of Trick in order to lock a foe into a single move, but it has better things to do and already stallbreaks well enough with Taunt. Thunder Wave can be used to shut down opposing sweepers, but Azelf lacks room for the move. Rain Dance and Damp Rock can be used to set up rain for offensive rain teams that want to wait on bringing Politoed in. A special attacking lead set can be used due to Azelf's colorful offensive movepool, but the coverage of Fire Blast is typically superior to that of Azelf's other moves.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Tyranitar will OHKO Azelf with Crunch (or Pursuit if Azelf switches), while Azelf cannot 2HKO Tyranitar back even with the rare Grass Knot. Weavile and Bisharp will bring Azelf down to its Focus Sash, and both will move first due to Weavile's higher Speed and Bisharp's access to Sucker Punch. However, neither Weavile nor Bisharp will survive a Fire Blast.</p>

<p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Once Azelf has been brought down to its Focus Sash, a priority attacker such as Diggersby or a Choice Scarf user such as Landorus-T can pick Azelf off easily.</p>

<p><strong>Defoggers</strong>: Though Defoggers such as Zapdos cannot threaten Azelf directly due to the threats of Taunt and Explosion, they can easily wipe out your team's entry hazards or dual screens once Azelf faints.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Lopunny</strong>: Mega Lopunny can break Azelf's Focus Sash with a powerful Fake Out and then outspeed and KO Azelf with a STAB Return, thus keeping Stealth Rock off the field.</p>

<p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye will bounce back Azelf's Stealth Rock, and using Skill Swap against them will give the Magic Bounce user a free turn. Furthermore, neither Mega Diancie nor Mega Sableye fears Explosion due to their defensive typings.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl, Thundurus, and Prankster Sableye can all Taunt Azelf and prevent it from setting up entry hazards and dual screens. Fortunately, faster Taunt users are rare.</p>

<p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Sandstorm damage, poison, and burn are all ways to break Azelf's Focus Sash, allowing it to be OHKOed.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-Hit Moves</strong>: Mega Heracross's Pin Missile and Breloom's Bullet Seed are two ways to break Azelf's Focus Sash. However, Azelf outspeeds both Mega Heracross and Breloom, so it will always be able to at least set up Stealth Rock before fainting. </p>

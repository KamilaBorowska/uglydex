<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>With an excellent base 121 Speed and 100% accurate Hurricane, Mega Pidgeot has the tools to be a legitimate threat in the OU tier. Many teams are unequiped to switch into repeated, drawback-free Hurricanes, especially combined with Pidgeot's U-turn, which allows it to wear down and keep momentum against Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Heatran. It is also pretty much the only Pokemon that can utilize Hyper Beam effectively, allowing it to surprise the opponent by KOing a Pokemon like Rotom-W for a partner to sweep. Mega Pidgeot's main issue is competition with Tornadus-T, which has the same Speed tier, better coverage, Regenerator, and more power with Life Orb taken into consideration while not taking up a Mega slot. It also requires fairly specific support to deal with Heatran and Tyranitar. With all of these factors taken into consideration, Mega Pidgeot is a fairly niche pick in the OU tier, but can nonetheless be effective with the right support if played to its strengths.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Hurricane is a high-powered STAB move that has 100% accuracy with Mega Pidgeot's ability and a 30% chance to confuse the foe. Heat Wave is the best coverage option that Mega Pidgeot has given its small movepool. With being worn down by Stealth Rock and its poor bulk, Mega Pidgeot greatly appreciates the increase in longevity from Roost. Hyper Beam is another option that can be used as a last-ditch effort to heavily damage or KO an opposing Pokemon; Mega Pidgeot often runs into situations where it is too weak to KO before it is KOed in return, situations in which Hyper Beam can be very useful. Some examples of Pokemon that KOes are Thundurus, Rotom-W after it has taken Hurricane + Stealth Rock damage, Landorus, and Mega Manectric. Last but not least, U-turn allows Mega Pidgeot to keep up momentum and wear down Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Heatran if entry hazards are up.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>4 EVs are placed in Defense rather than HP to give Pidgeot an odd HP number, allowing Pidgeot to switch into Stealth Rock four times without fainting. Maximum Special Attack investment is used for maximum damage output. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature are used to allow Mega Pidgeot to outpace as much as possible with its good Speed tier.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>It is advised to try to keep Stealth Rock off the field as long as Mega Pidgeot is healthy, as the entry hazard takes away a quarter of its health upon switching in. Thanks to Mega Pidgeot's great combination of Speed and power, it is an effective late-game cleaner when the opponent's bulky Pokemon have been worn down. When using Hyper Beam, take care that the recharge turn won't allow the opponent to set up and win, or anything to that effect.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Entry hazard removers such as Latias, Latios, Starmie, Tentacruel, and Excadrill keep Mega Pidgeot from losing a fourth of its health upon switching into battle. Focus Sash Dugtrio is a great partner because it can trap Heatran and Tyranitar for Mega Pidgeot. Mega Pidgeot's U-turn can also break the Air Balloon of a Heatran as it switches in, allowing Dugtrio to successfully trap it. Celebi can take Electric-type attacks, scare out Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Mega Diancie, set up Stealth Rock to help Mega Pidgeot clean late-game, or Baton Passing a Nasty Plot to Mega Pidgeot for formidable power.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Work Up can be used to give Mega Pidgeot very high power and allow it to clean up late-game, but in most scenarios it is better to attack twice rather than set up a Work Up. Defog is an option, but is not that great on Pidgeot because it is weak to Stealth Rock. Mega Pidgeot can use Tailwind to assist Pokemon on its team, which can sometimes change the tide of a match altogether. Hidden Power Grass can hit Rhyperior and Rotom-W very hard, which can normally take on Mega Pidgeot with ease. Hidden Power Ground and Hidden Power Fighting can be used for the same purpose against Heatran and Tyranitar, respectively, if your team has a particularly hard time against either of these Pok√©mon, but it's mostly optimal to just use U-turn with Dugtrio on your team.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Mega Manectric are common checks to Mega Pidgeot. The first two are hard counters to Mega Pidgeot, as they take minimal damage from its attacks and are able to KO it with little difficulty. Mega Manectric can switch into a Hurricane then proceed to outspeed and subsequently KO Mega Pidgeot.</p>

<p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran completely walls Mega Pidgeot if Hidden Power Ground isn't being used.</p>

<p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar stops Mega Pidgeot dead in its tracks if Hidden Power Fighting isn't being used; Rhyperior can do the same if Mega Pidgeot lacks Hidden Power Grass. Mega Diancie and Mega Aerodactyl in particular beat Mega Pidgeot regardless of its moves.</p>

<p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey completely stop Mega Pidgeot. Their unparalleled special bulk and reliable recovery allow them to eat up Hurricanes; they can also chip away at Mega Pidgeot's health with Seismic Toss or Toxic or cripple it with Thunder Wave.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Mega Pidgeot is fast, but Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Mega Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Garchomp can check Mega Pidgeot because they are capable of switching into at least one of its moves then outspeeding and KOing it.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Excellent Speed, typing, and bulk make Latias a solid threat in OU. By virtue of its Dragon / Psychic typing and reliable recovery, Latias checks common threats such as Thundurus, Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, Celebi, Starmie, and Keldeo. Latias has an excellent support movepool, most notably including Healing Wish to revive setup sweepers and Defog to clear entry hazards. With access to Stored Power and a significantly bulkier Mega Evolution, Latias has regained its role as a Calm Mind user.</p>

<p>However, Latias faces competition from its twin, Latios, due to its greater offensive presence. Latias is also troubled by common Steel- and Fairy-types in OU, such as Heatran, Scizor, Mega Metagross, Bisharp, Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Azumarill, which prevent it from constantly using its STAB moves and threaten to OHKO or severely damage Latias. Despite its useful resistances, Latias is weak to common attacking types such as Dark, Ice, Bug, Fairy, and Dragon.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Defog clears all entry hazards from the field to support the team. Draco Meteor is a powerful STAB move that deals heavy damage to many offensive Pokemon such as Landorus, Thundurus, Mega Pinsir, Mega Gallade, and Mega Manectric. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that targets specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey, Sylveon, and Azumarill, as well as Fighting- and Poison-types such as Keldeo, Breloom, Conkeldurr, Gengar, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss. Alternatively, Thunderbolt hits bulky Water- and Flying-types such as Azumarill, Suicune, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz. Thunderbolt also retains coverage on Keldeo, one of the most important Pokemon Latias is used to check. Healing Wish revives a weakened setup sweeper, giving it a second chance to sweep. Roost can be used if the utility of Healing Wish is not needed for your team, and it allows Latias to check said threats multiple times throughout a battle. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Bisharp, Scizor, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fighting scores an OHKO on Bisharp whereas Hidden Power Fire cannot, as well as dealing solid damage to Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar. Surf is yet another coverage move that hits both Landorus formes, Gliscor, Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Heatran for solid damage. Alternate combinations of these moves apart from the given choices, such as a set with three attacks and Healing Wish, can be used if Defog support is not necessary; a set with Healing Wish, Roost, and two attacks can also be used.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed base 108 Speed Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion and tie with opposing base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Gallade, Latios, Latias, and Gengar. The given EV spread lets Latias avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice without Stealth Rock damage and also hits a Life Orb number. Subsequently, the remaining 184 Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Landorus after Stealth Rock damage. Alternatively, a spread of 104 HP / 152 SpA / 252 Spe lets Latias survive a Life Orb-boosted Knock Off from Landorus after Stealth Rock damage. Lastly, a simple EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can be used if hitting hard is more beneficial to your team than the bulk.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Latias should pivot into Pokemon that it walls or can take a hit from, such as Keldeo, Thundurus, Landorus, Rotom-W, Starmie, Celebi, and Mega Charizard Y. Despite being Latias's strongest attack, Draco Meteor should be used sparingly due to the numerous Pokemon that resist or are immune to it, and the Special Attack drops can give setup opportunities to deadly sweepers such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Scizor, Mega Sableye, Mega Diancie, and Bisharp. However, Draco Meteor's high power is important when revenge killing threats such as the aforementioned Landorus. That being said, Psyshock is often a fairly safe attack to go for, provided the opponent does not have a Dark-type. It is important to scout for coverage moves from the Pokemon that Latias typically walls, such as Icy Wind from Keldeo, Knock Off or Hidden Power Ice from Landorus and Thundurus, and Ice Beam from Starmie. Use Latias's support moves when given the opportunity versus the Pokemon it checks. Keep in mind that it is important to preserve Latias throughout the battle if the opponent has threats such as Mega Charizard Y or Keldeo.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny make for excellent teammates, as they check Dark-types, particularly Bisharp. Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill threaten opposing Dragons and check most Dark-types apart from Bisharp. Azumarill also appreciates Latias's ability to switch into Grass- and Electric-type attacks. Setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Calm Mind Keldeo, Swords Dance Mega Scizor, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Manaphy value the support provided by Healing Wish.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>A defensive set with moves such as Wish and Reflect Type has some merit, but Latias is generally outclassed as a defensive Psychic-type by Pokemon such as Celebi, Slowbro, and Cresselia. A dual screens set provides support for setup sweepers, but this role is generally better done by Azelf. Ice Beam hits both Landorus formes, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Gliscor for 4x super effective damage.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, Mega Metagross, and Weavile can pick off or KO a weakened Latias. However, all of them must fear a Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Fighting, and Weavile cannot switch into a Draco Meteor.</p>

<p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey, Hippowdon, and Celebi can easily take a hit from Latias and cripple it or pivot out into a teammate.</p>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Heatran, Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and Jirachi resist Latias's STAB moves and threaten it with a strong attack. However, all of them with the exception of Heatran must be wary of Hidden Power Fire.</p>

<p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Clefable, Mega Altaria, and Sylveon are immune to Draco Meteor and are bulky enough to shrug off a Psyshock.</p>

<p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Houndoom, Weavile, and Thundurus and Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Diggersby, and Hydreigon can revenge kill a weakened Latias. </p>

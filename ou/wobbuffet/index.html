<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Although Wobbuffet is a very specialized Pokemon, it is very good at what it does: revenge killing and trapping. While Wobbuffet appears to have competition from a fellow Shadow Tag user, Gothitelle, Wobbuffet has some notable advantages over it. Wobbuffet is able to fit onto offensive teams more easily than Gothitelle, has a better matchup against offense, and has Encore to handle Pokemon that try to set up on it. While Knock Off's high usage is a problem for Wobbuffet, it can beat some common Knock Off users, such as Azumarill and Landorus-T, one-on-one. However, Wobbuffet is mostly one-dimensional, as it is limited to revenge killing and trapping, has no recovery outside of whatever item it is holding, and is hurt by its low Speed against defensive Pokemon that it would lock into a move with Encore.</p>

<h1>Oh no, it's Wobbuffet!</h1>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Encore can lock the foe into a move that a teammate can take advantage of and can prevent Wobbuffet from being set up on by sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X. Counter and Mirror Coat allow Wobbuffet to return damage back to a foe that hits it with a physical or special attack, respectively. Safeguard protects Wobbuffet and its teammates from status for a few turns, allowing teammates to come in safely on an Encored status move.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The investment in HP and Defense allows Wobbuffet to survive a Knock Off from Life Orb Bisharp while holding an item, which can be handy in a pinch. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to allow Wobbuffet to take special attacks much easier. Sitrus Berry is preferred over Leftovers because Wobbuffet wants to have an instant form of recovery and because it gets worn down a lot. Also, using up an item allows Wobbuffet to take Knock Offs better. However, Leftovers can be used instead for gradual recovery.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Wobbuffet is a team supporter primarily for offensive teams by trapping or KOing Pokemon that are causing problems for Wobbuffet's teammates. Wobbuffet is best brought in when a teammate has been KOed, or from a U-turn or Volt Switch. Wobbuffet should not be played too recklessly, as it gets worn down rather easily, but one must not be afraid to use it in fear of it getting worn down. Be smart with Encore due to its low PP, but again, do not be afraid to use it. Encore in general is meant to take advantage of the opponent; for example, Wobbuffet can be used as an anti-lead by locking the opponent into Stealth Rock for a teammate to take advantage of. Wobbuffet dislikes Knock Off users, but it can beat some of them one-on-one, such as Azumarill and Landorus-T.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Wobbuffet provides valuable support for offensive teams and prefers these over balanced teams. For teammates, Wobbuffet greatly appreciates Healing Wish support because it gets worn down very easily, so Latias and Jirachi are good teammates. Wobbuffet's combination of Shadow Tag + Encore can benefit setup sweepers by giving them free turns to set up. Lucario and Mega Charizard X appreciate Wobbuffet's support and its ability to trap and KO Excadrill, which the two usually struggle with. Other setup sweepers, such as Dragonite and Diggersby, can make good teammates as well. Wobbuffet is troubled a lot by Bisharp, which can threaten to KO it after some prior damage with Knock Off or Pursuit; as such, a Fighting-type, such as Terrakion or Keldeo, makes for a good teammate to handle Bisharp. Landorus pairs well with Destiny Bond Wobbuffet, which handles Latias and Chansey for Landorus.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Tickle can be used with a Pursuit trapper to remove the opponent's walls from the match, but this is gimmicky at best, and Wobbuffet has better things to do. Destiny Bond looks good on paper to score a free KO once Wobbuffet is at low health, but it really misses Safeguard, often lacks the Speed to pull it off, and does not have room for it.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Bisharp</strong>: Bisharp is a huge pain in the neck for Wobbuffet, as it can KO Wobbuffet with Knock Off or trap a weakened Wobbuffet with Pursuit. However, Bisharp should not be too reckless, as trying to set up on Wobbuffet or failing to KO it can backfire and be exploited.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt + Status</strong>: Taunt and status debilitate Wobbuffet and can keep it from doing its job as efficiently. Wobbuffet can function when Taunted, but it needs more prediction in this case. Poison and burn wear down Wobbuffet, and other forms of status hinder it as well.</p>

<p><strong>VoltTurn + Counter / Mirror Coat immunities</strong>: The easiest way to handle Wobbuffet is to U-turn or Volt Switch into a Ghost- or Dark-type, the former type being immune to Counter and the latter type being immune to Mirror Coat. This prevents Wobbuffet from doing its job and minimizes the damage it inflicts upon the opponent's team.</p>

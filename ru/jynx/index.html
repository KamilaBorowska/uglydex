<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>With Jynx's high Special Attack and Speed stats, it's no wonder it was so threatening in previous generations. While it faces competition from other Psychic-types, such as Delphox and Meloetta, it sets itself apart with Lovely Kiss, which can put a foe to sleep and enable Jynx to set up Nasty Plot with ease. Jynx also has access to an array of coverage options and excellent STAB moves to take advantage of its offensive stats. What makes Jynx stand out the most, however, is its ability Dry Skin, which lets it switch into most bulky Water-types without taking damage. Jynx also has a great matchup against lead Omastar, as Jynx can outspeed itand put it to sleep before it gets the chance to set up entry hazards. Unfortunately, Jynx is set back by its pathetic bulk and vulnerability to priority attacks. It's also weak to Stealth Rock and the omnipresent Knock Off, which lower its HP immensely. While Jynx's Speed is good, it isn't by any means incredible, as threats such as Durant and Delphox can easily outspeed it</p>

<h1>Lovely Kiss + 3 Attacks</h1>

<div class=set>
    Jynx @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Dry Skin<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Lovely Kiss<br>- Ice Beam<br>- Psyshock / Psychic<br>- Focus Blast
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Lovely Kiss enables Jynx to put foes to sleep and proceed to pound through opposing Pokemon. Ice Beam is a good STAB move with nothing immune to it and few resisting it. The third move is a toss-up between two Psychic-type STAB moves. Psyshock hits special walls, such as Aromatisse, much harder than Jynx's other moves, while Psychic can enable Jynx to break through Pokemon such as Alomomola. Focus Blast crushes most Steel-types that would otherwise be able to wall Jynx. Shadow Ball can be run over Focus Blast to nail Doublade and Delphox on the switch and enables Jynx to hit bulky Psychic-types, such as Cresselia and Slowking, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire hits Assault Vest Escavalier and Durant much harder than any of Jynx's other coverage moves, being able to 2HKO and OHKO them after Stealth Rock, respectively.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EV spread and nature allow Jynx to Speed tie with other positively natured base 95s, while hitting very hard. Life Orb gives Jynx much more power, letting it 2HKO Alomomola and Registeel and potentially OHKO Rhyperior. Dry Skin can give Jynx a free switch into a predicted Water-type move, allowing it to put a foe to sleep. Focus Sash can be run over Life Orb to almost guarantee Jynx can put something to sleep, assuming hazards are not up on its side of the field, and it is especially useful against Omastar leads.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Jynx's foes should be put to sleep on the switch so Jynx can proceed to set up or attack. Jynx needs to be switched in safely because its bulk is incredibly poor, and it can come in safely by switching into a predicted Water-type move, pivoting in via U-turn or Volt Switch, or switching in after a teammate faints. This set is most effective early- to mid-game.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Jynx appreciates Rapid Spin and Defog support from Pokemon such as Hitmonlee and Shiftry, as it doesn't like taking Stealth Rock damage. Dugtrio is an excellent teammate, as it can trap most of the Steel-, Fire-, and Rock-types that threaten Jynx and potentially wipe them out. Wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Durant and Choice Specs Clawitzer, can handle exceptionally bulky Pokemon that Jynx can't do much damage to, such as Cresselia and Cofagrigus.</p>

<h1>Choice Scarf</h1>

<div class=set>
    Jynx @ Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Dry Skin<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Psyshock / Psychic<br>- Ice Beam<br>- Lovely Kiss<br>- Trick / Focus Blast
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Psyshock and Psychic are both STAB moves, but Psyshock hits special walls and Assault Vest users hard, while Psychic hits bulky Water-types like Alomomola. Ice Beam is a secondary STAB move that hits some bulky Pokemon, such as Druddigon, Gligar, and Rhyperior. Lovely Kiss in conjunction with Choice Scarf makes for a really fast sleep-inducing move. Trick is excellent for crippling walls, while Focus Blast can be used to hit Steel-types on the switch. Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Fire can be run in place of Focus Blast; the former hits Doublade and other bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, while the latter hits Durant and Escavalier.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>With maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs and a Choice Scarf, Jynx not only hits hard, but also outspeeds the entire unboosted tier, as well as some other Choice Scarf users, such as Emboar. A Timid nature is used to outspeed as many threats as possible, including opposing Choice Scarf users without a Speed-boosting nature. Dry Skin can give Jynx a free switch into a predicted Water-type move, especially against bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Jellicent.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This set is excellent at revenge killing and cleaning up late-game. Jynx should use Lovely Kiss early on to possibly cripple an opposing Pokemon for the entire match. It should use Trick to render a wall helpless, which is especially helpful if Jynx's teammates need it removed. Due to Jynx's poor bulk, it needs to switch in safely; otherwise, it is at risk of being OHKOed.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Wallbreakers, such as Clawitzer and Choice Band Durant, can break through walls that Jynx can't and make it easier for Jynx to clean up late-game. Defoggers and spinners, such as Golbat and Hitmonlee, can get rid of entry hazards for Jynx, which easily rack up damage otherwise. Skuntank in particular is an excellent teammate, as it can Defog hazards away as well as Pursuit trap Doublade, among other Ghost- and Psychic-types. Dugtrio can trap bulky Steel-types and eliminate them with its STAB Earthquake, while Sucker Punch users, such as Skuntank and Emboar, are able to KO Ghost-types.</p>

<h1>Seduction Smasher</h1>

<div class=set>
    Jynx @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Dry Skin<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Lovely Kiss<br>- Nasty Plot<br>- Ice Beam<br>- Substitute
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Lovely Kiss puts a foe to sleep so Jynx can proceed to set up with Nasty Plot and Substitute. Nasty Plot increases Ice Beam's damage output and puts offensive pressure on the opponent. Ice Beam is Jynx's best attack for this set, as nothing is immune to it, and it gets good neutral coverage, being resisted only by Steel-, Fire-, Ice-, and Water-types, most of which are not commonly used defensively. Substitute is a safe way to avoid status, and Jynx can find many opportunities to set it up, especially against walls such as Aromatisse.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Special Attack EVs enable Jynx to hit really hard after a Nasty Plot, potentially 2HKOing some Pokemon that resist Ice Beam, such as Doublade. Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature are used so Jynx can outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, as it can't afford to take a hit. With Dry Skin, Jynx can switch into predicted Water-type moves, especially from bulky Water-types such as Alomomola. Leftovers is important to help mitigate health lost from Substitute.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>It's important that Jynx switches in safely, as it has very little bulk; it can do this by switching into a Water-type move, having teammates who can use Volt Switch and U-turn, or switching in after a teammate has fainted. Jynx should switch into walls, especially bulky Water-types, to hit them with Lovely Kiss. Afterwards, Jynx should set up Substitute and Nasty Plot while the opposing Pokemon is asleep and proceed to use Ice Beam after a boost or two.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin and Defog users, such as Hitmontop and Gligar, are important to get rid of entry hazards, as Jynx is weak to Stealth Rock. U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Swellow and Jolteon, are useful at getting Jynx in safely. Dugtrio is a great teammate due to its ability to trap most Steel- and Fire-types and wipe them out with Earthquake. Skuntank can provide great support to Jynx, as it can Defog hazards away and trap Doublade with Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Life Orb Hitmonlee can also be a great teammate, as it can clear entry hazards away with Rapid Spin and wipe out most bulky Pokemon that resist Ice Beam.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Jynx could run a Calm Mind set, but with the prevalence of Pokemon such as Moltres, Hitmonlee, Delphox, and Doublade, it is very difficult for Jynx to manage a more bulky spread. Focus Sash can be run in conjunction with Counter to lure in and KO Escavalier, but it has little use outside of that and is gimmicky at best. A trapping set consisting of Mean Look, Lovely Kiss, Perish Song, and Substitute could be utilized, but this makes Jynx Taunt bait, while running an attacking move in place of Substitute puts Jynx at risk of being OHKOed the moment the opposing Pokemon wakes up. Jynx can run an anti-lead set with Taunt, Lovely Kiss, Light Screen, and Reflect, but it's mostly outclassed in this role by Meowstic-M. Fake Out can be run to beat entry hazard leads such as Omastar and Kricketune without activating Sleep Clause, but it is almost useless against Accelgor and Cobalion and is typically a waste of a moveslot if the opponent lacks a suicide lead.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock can severely limit Jynx's lifespan, especially for the Choice Scarf and Lovely Kiss + 3 Attacks sets.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Pokemon</strong>: Naturally fast Pokemon such as Durant and Delphox can remove Jynx with ease, especially if they are wielding a Choice Scarf, as it enables them to successfully revenge kill every variant of Jynx. Sharpedo can outspeed Jynx after a boost or two and KO it with Dark Pulse or Crunch.</p>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: Almost every form of priority bar Aqua Jet will OHKO Jynx after Stealth Rock. Both Shadow Sneak from Doublade and Sucker Punch from Skuntank can OHKO Jynx, but Sucker Punch users must be wary of Lovely Kiss and Substitute.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: If Jynx lacks Focus Blast, Steel-types such as Magneton and Registeel can wall it; if Jynx lacks Shadow Ball, Pokemon such as Doublade and Bronzong can wall it.</p>

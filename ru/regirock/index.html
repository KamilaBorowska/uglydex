<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Regirock is a pretty good Pokemon in RU, thanks to its solid defensive stats and typing that allows it to check some key threats, most importantly Moltres. However, Regirock faces huge competition from Rhyperior. While Rhyperior is often the superior choice, Regirock does have some notable advantages, most importantly its lack of exploitable 3x weakness to Grass- and Water-type moves. This makes it a much better check to Moltres and Exploud. Unlike Rhyperior, Regirock has access to Thunder Wave, which allows it to slow down key threats for the rest of its team.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Stealth Rock is arguably the most important move in the game, and Regirock is a very consistent Stealth Rock setter thanks to its massive defenses. Rock Slide is the STAB move of choice, as it hits key threats such as Moltres, Fletchinder, and Delphox, which can often be trouble for slower teams. Protect is a great move on Regirock, as it allows Regirock to gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and scout the opponent's next move. The last move is a toss-up between Toxic and Thunder Wave. On more defensively oriented teams, Toxic is useful for wearing down the opponent's Pokemon. On more balanced teams, however, Regirock's teammates will appreciate the speed control provided by Thunder Wave, allowing heavy hitters more opportunities to come in and fire off powerful attacks. Thunder Wave also has excellent synergy with Rock Slide, and can sometimes allow Regirock to get around an opponent that it shouldn't be able to beat. Earthquake is another decent choice for Regirock as it has stellar coverage alongside Rock Slide, but it is very hard to find room for it on this set.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>HP and Special Defense are maxed alongside a Careful nature to allow Regirock to check major threats such as Moltres and Exploud. Leftovers is the item of choice, as Regirock has no other form of recovery.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Regirock has really good mixed bulk and can be used to check a lot of different Pokemon; however, due to its lack of reliable recovery, it is easily worn down. Protect is extremely useful for scouting the foe's move, especially when you know it is Choice-locked; however, spamming Protect can allow your opponent to set up on Regirock. It is very important to conserve Regirock if your opponent has Fletchinder or Moltres, as it is very likely that you will need Regirock to take them out.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Aromatisse is a great partner for Regirock, as Regirock tends to give free turns to the many Fighting-type Pokemon in RU, especially Gurdurr, which actually enjoys switching into Regirock's status moves. Aromatisse also provides Wish and Aromatherapy support to keep Regirock healthy. Drapion can check the Psychic-types that are able to set up on Regirock, such as Substitute + Calm Mind Cresselia and Calm Mind Reuniclus, while also absorbing Toxic Spikes, which can really wear Regirock down. Alomomola is another decent choice to pair with Regirock, as it can pass huge Wishes to Regirock. Doublade doesn't really care about anything that Regirock can do to it, so Pokemon that easily deal with Doublade make for good partners to Regirock. Meloetta is a more offensively oriented teammate which can easily handle Doublade thanks to its typing and high Special Attack. Weezing is another good choice, as it can take on the Fighting- and Ground-types that trouble Regirock while also countering Doublade. Finally, Spiritomb is capable of handling Fighting-types and Doublade while spinblocking and countering Substitute + Calm Mind Pokemon.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Regirock doesn't really have a lot to work with outside of this main set. An Assault Vest set with Drain Punch for HP recovery might seem appealing, but is both weak and easily worn down. Assault Vest also prevents Regirock from using its support moves. Stone Edge is a more powerful STAB move for Regirock, but it has lower accuracy, loses out on the chance to flinch a paralyzed opponent, and it has extremely low PP, allowing Moltres to Pressure stall it out. Psych Up can be used to steal boosts from Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, but has little use outside of that specific situation.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Both Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are really devastating for Regirock, as it is very easy to wear down without constant Leftovers recovery.</p>

<p><strong>Calm Mind Users</strong>: Cresselia and Reuniclus are all capable of setting up on Regirock and then sweeping its team.</p>

<p><strong>Alomomola</strong>: Regirock can't touch Alomomola barring Toxic, and Alomomola can pass Wishes to its teammates or fire off some free Scalds.</p>

<p><strong>Doublade</strong>: Doublade sets up Swords Dance on Regirock all day, and Regirock can do pretty much nothing back.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting-Types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Cobalion, Gurdurr, and Virizion can switch into Regirock's Rock Slide quite easily and can either break through it with super effective attacks, or set up on it.</p>

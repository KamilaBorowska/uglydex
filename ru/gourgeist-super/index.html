<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>With a good typing and great physical bulk, this pumpkin can take quite a few hits before going down. Access to Will-O-Wisp allows it cripple physical attackers like Escavalier, and makes Gourgeist-XL even harder to break, while its decent Attack allows it to actually hurt the Pokemon it's supposed to wall with STAB Seed Bomb instead of relying solely on passive damage. Unfortunately, Gourgeist-XL has fairly low Speed, a lack of reliable recovery options, and a set of weaknesses that also leave it particularly threatened by the omnipresent Knock Off. These issues shouldn't deter you from using it, though, because very few physical attackers can hope to break through it without super effective STAB moves.</p>

<h1>Physically Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Gourgeist-Super @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Frisk<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br>
    Impish Nature<br>
    - Protect<br>- Leech Seed<br>- Will-O-Wisp<br>- Seed Bomb
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Protect allows Gourgeist-XL to recover HP via Leftovers and Leech Seed, rack up burn and Leech Seed damage, and scout for moves. Leech Seed lets Gourgeist-XL both recover health and do some residual damage to opponents who are immune to Will-O-Wisp. Will-O-Wisp is primarily used to burn physical attackers, making them nearly useless for the rest of the match unless the opposing team has a cleric, while also having the added effect of doing residual damage. Seed Bomb is for a STAB attack, letting Gourgeist-XL hit Ground-, Rock- and Water-type Pokemon that it walls hard and also allows it to 2HKO Hitmonlee, letting Gourgeist-XL spinblock it fairly effectively.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EVs and Impish nature maximize Gourgeist-XL's physical bulk. The residual healing provided by Leftovers is much more useful then what any other item could offer, and Frisk allows Gourgeist-XL to scout the item of the current opposing Pokemon, which eases mind games, making Pokemon that rely on unpredictability far less dangerous.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Gourgeist-XL's bulk allows it to take many physical hits and respond with status or Seed Bomb. Switch it into physical Ground-, Fighting-, Water-, Grass-, and Normal-type sweepers who really can't do much against it, and start spreading burns and Leech Seed to wear them and possible switch-ins down. Leech Seed is Gourgeist-XL's only source of recovery aside from Leftovers, so use it whenever possible to keep it healthy. Protect can also help Gourgeist-XL gain additional healing from Leftovers and Leech Seed by stalling for a turn, but don't use it too often as some sweepers might use it as a set up opportunity and put Gourgeist-XL in a tight spot.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>As a physical wall with no reliable recovery, Gourgeist-XL appreciates Wish support. Alomomola and Aromatisse can provide this while switching into Fire- and Ice-type attacks and Dark-type attacks, respectively. In return, Gourgeist-XL can switch into Grass- and Electric-type attacks for Alomomola and takes physical Steel- and Poison-type attacks for Aromatisse. Teammates that can cover for Gourgeist-XL's weaknesses, such as Rhyperior for its Flying-type weakness and Drapion for its Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses, are also recommended. Gourgeist-XL, like many defensive Pokemon, hates Toxic Spikes as the passive damage can add up pretty easily and also negates Leftovers recovery. Drapion can remove them by merely switching in and can set up Toxic Spikes of its own, which helps Gourgeist-XL with its stalling tactics. Do note that Toxic Spikes can work against you, as it prevents some physical threats from being burned by Gourgeist-XL. Lastly, entry hazard support is always welcome because Leech Seed can force switches and wears opponents down even more. Registeel, in addition to Rhyperior, can set up Stealth Rock and has good synergy with Gourgeist-XL.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Fire Blast with a Relaxed nature can lure in some threats like Lum Berry Durant that are hoping to use Gourgeist-XL as setup bait and eliminate them, but it only works for Pokemon 4x weak to Fire such as Escavalier and Durant, and Gourgeist-XL is better off using Will-O-Wisp to burn them anyway. Pain Split is an option to make Gourgeist-XL a bit less reliant on Wish support, but it needs an opponent that is at high health to be effective, and it will barely recover anything most of the time due to all the residual damage output. Finally, Shadow Sneak is an option if one is really scared of a +2 20% Mismagius or something similar going through the team with no means of stopping it. However, while Gourgeist-XL has a decent Attack stat, it will be uninvested, making Shadow Sneak weak and giving it little utility outside of those specific scenarios.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types care little for either Seed Bomb or Will-O-Wisp and can take Gourgeist-XL out in one go, specially or physically inclined. However, they can be worn down by Leech Seed quite easily, especially in conjunction with Stealth Rock.</p>

<p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon are the same as Fire-types for the most part, but they can get burned as well, wearing them down fast.</p>

<p><strong>Other Ghost-types</strong>: Lack of a Ghost-type STAB move means that Gourgeist-XL can't really do damage to other Ghost-types outside of Seed Bomb, and they can smack Gourgeist-XL back with super effective STAB moves of their own. However, they are still prone to passive damage and, special attackers aside, all mind burn due their Attack getting halved.</p>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: They are capable of hitting Gourgeist-XL hard, but are prone to passive damage, and Will-O-Wisp hinders physical attackers that test their luck.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Although it's not really a counter in the strict sense, passively damaging status negates Leftovers and can reduce Gourgeist-XL's offensive presence greatly in the case of burn, making it prone to being worn down and unable to scare out threats with Seed Bomb.</p>

<h1>Tiers</h1>

</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>With its impressive defenses and unique Rock / Grass typing, Cradily can hold its own against various Pokemon, including Choice Specs Exploud and Slowking. Cradily also boasts a large movepool including moves such as Giga Drain, Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Sludge Bomb. To top it all off, Storm Drain makes Cradily immune to Water-type attacks while also raising its Special Attack. However, despite Cradily’s huge arsenal of moves, it relies heavily on Toxic to deal significant damage to opposing Pokemon. While Cradily has a very easy time switching into Slowking, one of the top defensive threats in RU, it can have a hard time wearing Slowking down due to Regenerator. Cradily is also weak to some of the stronger offensive Pokemon in the tier, such as Doublade and Cobalion. Finally, Cradily’s low Speed causes it to move slower than most enemies and leaves it susceptible to Taunt and status such as burn and poison.</p>

<h1>Specially Defensive</h1>

    - Stealth Rock<br>- Giga Drain / Toxic<br>- Rock Slide<br>- Recover
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Stealth Rock is a great move, as Cradily often pressures opponents into switching back and forth, racking up residual damage. Giga Drain allows Cradily to not only regain its health, but also punish Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Kabutops which are both 4x weak to Grass-type moves. Instead of Giga Drain, Toxic can be used to allow Cradily to slowly whittle away at the opponent. This works especially well in conjunction with Stealth Rock, as the opposing Pokemon is likely to switch out if it is badly poisoned. Rock Slide is a great STAB move that can check deadly threats such as Moltres and Delphox. Lastly, Recover is used to allow Cradily to stall out opposing Pokemon and keep itself healthy throughout the match.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Sassy nature allows Cradily to stall out special attackers as best as it can. Leftovers provides Cradily with continuous recovery, while Rocky Helmet is an option to punish physical attackers. If Toxic is being used instead of Giga Drain, a Careful nature can be used to boost Special Defense while not lowering Cradily's Speed.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Setting up Stealth Rock as fast as possible is crucial in order to rack up residual damage from the opposing team switching in and out. While this occurs, Toxic can be thrown out repeatedly to force the opposing team to switch even more, causing even more Stealth Rock damage. Try to switch Cradily out against Steel-types such as Doublade to prevent severe damage. Send Cradily out against Pokemon that use Hydro Pump, Scald, and other Water-type moves to gain a free boost to its Special Attack. Cradily can also check Cinccino because it resists Tail Slap.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon such as Delphox, Rhyperior, and Dugtrio can take out dangerous Steel-types such as Escavalier, Durant, and Cobalion while Cradily can switch into the Water-type attacks they hate. Aromatisse can provide cleric support while dealing with Fighting-types fairly well. Weezing can set up Toxic Spikes to further wear down the opposing team and can check Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee. Slowking is a great partner because it can spread burns via Scald, weakening dangerous physical attackers. Alomomola also makes for a great defensive teammate due to its high HP and resistance to Steel- and Ice-type attacks while Cradily resists Grass- and Electric-type attacks for Alomomola. Sandslash baits Water-type attacks for Cradily to absorb as well as being able to Rapid Spin away troubling entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes. Spiritomb is also a great spinblocker that fares better against Hitmonlee than Doublade. Lastly, Doublade is a great counter to Cobalion, Virizion, and most other Fighting-types due to its Steel / Ghost typing, which also allows it to spinblock.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Cradily can utilize Stockpile and Suction Cups in conjunction with Toxic to stall the opposing team while being immune to phazing moves. Cradily can also utilize Leech Seed to not only regain health but also quickly wear down opposing Pokemon in conjunction with Toxic. Curse is useful to turn Cradily into a physical tank as well as boost its Attack stat. Cradily can become an all-out physical attacker with Rock Slide, Earthquake, Seed Bomb, and Double-Edge with a Brave nature. Alternatively, Swords Dance can be used with Rock Slide, Bullet Seed, and Earthquake or Double-Edge as an offensive setup sweeper. Lastly, Cradily can utilize Ingrain to recover HP, although this can be detrimental if the opponent switches into a Pokemon with a super effective attack, as Cradily cannot switch out.</p>

<p>Checks &amp; Counters</p>

<p>===
<strong>Utility and Status Moves</strong>: Due to its low Speed, Taunt, Defog, and Rapid Spin can be used against Cradily with little cost. Toxic is also detrimental as it prevents Cradily from stalling out opposing Pokemon.</p>

<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Cobalion, Escavalier, Durant, Doublade, and Registeel can easily hit Cradily with a STAB Iron Head or Flash Cannon. Escavalier and Durant, being Bug / Steel types, can also utilize Megahorn and X-Scissor, respectively, giving them two different ways to deal with Cradily, and to make matters worst Rock Slide and Giga Drain do minimal damage to Bug / Steel types that resist them with ease.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Cradily cannot deal with Fighting-types such as Cobalion, Hitmonlee, and Emboar. Cobalion can 2HKO Cradily with Close Combat, while Reckless Hitmonlee can OHKO Cradily with High Jump Kick.</p>

<p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Drapion and Weezing can freely use Cradily as setup fodder, as they're immune to Toxic and take little damage from Rock Slide and Giga Drain.</p>

<p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Meloetta and Gallade do not care about Toxic or Leech Seed because of Substitute and can set up on Cradily with Calm Mind or Bulk Up, respectively.</p>

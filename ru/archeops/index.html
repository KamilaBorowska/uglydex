<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Archeops has a great Speed tier and access to Stealth Rock, Taunt, and Endeavor, all of which make it a great suicide lead for hyper offense teams. It outspeeds most relevant Taunt and Defog users, which can prevent entry hazards from being set up, and can even use Taunt and Endeavor to deal with stall teams. However, while Archeops seems able to run other sets, they are all unviable due to its bad defensive typing, which gives it a Stealth Rock weakness. Archeops's greatest downfall is its ability, Defeatist, which makes it unable to switch into even weak hits for fear of halving its offenses.</p>

<h1>Suicide Lead</h1>

<div class=set>
    Archeops @ Focus Sash<br>
    Ability: Defeatist<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br>
    Naive Nature<br>
    - Stealth Rock<br>- Taunt<br>- Endeavor<br>- Head Smash
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Archeops's ability to outspeed most Taunt and Defog users makes it easy for it to set Stealth Rock up. Taunt prevents opposing leads such as Cobalion from setting up entry hazards or boosting, and it denies Defog and status moves. Endeavor can cripple a foe once Archeops is knocked down to its Focus Sash, making it easy for a teammate to finish the foe off. Head Smash is used to block Rapid Spin and Defog when Archeops is down to its Focus Sash, as they fail when Archeops faints due to Head Smash's recoil; this also grants a teammate a free switch in. Rock Slide can be used over Head Smash, as it hits hard but doesn't break Archeops' Focus Sash; however, it cannot block Rapid Spin. Rock Tomb is also usable over Head Smash, as it slows down the foe, which can be useful against Choice Scarf users and can benefit a teammate.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>252 Attack EVs maximize Archeops's damage output, while 252 Speed EVs and a Naive nature maximize Archeops's Speed to outspeed threats such as Cobalion. A Naive nature and a 0 Special Defense IV make it easier to get to 1 HP, though 0 Defense and HP IVs are not recommended, as Archeops would forfeit its chance to survive Rhyperior's Rock Blast. A Focus Sash is necessary to allow Archeops to take a hit while it sets up Stealth Rock.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Archeops should almost always be used as a lead to set up Stealth Rock early-game. Always Taunt opposing leads to prevent them from setting entry hazards, and use Stealth Rock afterwards. It's a good idea to Taunt setup sweepers too, especially those that boost their Speed. Use Endeavor on Defog users if Archeops is at 1 HP to cripple them, and then set up Stealth Rock again. Against Rapid Spin users, Archeops should spinblock by knocking itself out with Head Smash instead of using Endeavor. Saving Archeops for later in the match is possible if you think Stealth Rock might be removed or you want to cripple bulky Pokemon with Endeavor. If the opponent has a Xatu and you predict it to switch in, use Head Smash instead of Stealth Rock, as Stealth Rock will be bounced back by Magic Bounce. Don't try to Taunt priority move users, as they can KO Archeops before it sets up Stealth Rock.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Most offensive Pokemon such as Tyrantrum, Fletchinder, and Houndoom appreciate Stealth Rock, as it allows them to KO Pokemon they otherwise would not be able to. Archeops can also prevent opposing leads from getting up Stealth Rock, which is helpful for Pokemon weak to it such as Houndoom, Mega Glalie, and Braviary. Wallbreakers, such as Exploud and Mega Glalie, which can break through bulky teams also make for good partners. A Rapid Spin user such as Hitmonlee can remove entry hazards from your side of the field without removing the Stealth Rock set up by Archeops. Braviary also makes for a great partner, as it deters Defog from being used with its ability Defiant. Priority move users such as Fletchinder and Doublade can be used to pick off Pokemon weakened by Endeavor. Finally, a spinblocker such as Doublade or Spiritomb is recommended to block Rapid Spin to prevent Stealth Rock from being removed.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Knock Off can be used to remove items such as Eviolite from foes, but Archeops is better off crippling them with Endeavor. Quick Attack combined with Endeavor can finish off weakened Pokemon, but this likely will not work more than once in a match. Tailwind can be used as a last resort, but it is hard to find room for. U-turn can be used to allow Archeops to pivot out and switch in later in the game, but it is shut down by opposing Stealth Rock. A set with 3 attacks and Stealth Rock could possibly be used thanks to Archeops's high Speed but is worn down quickly by Stealth Rock and is not a reliable lead. A Defog set is somewhat viable, as it can potentially surprise an opponent while not losing any offensive presence.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Multi-hit Attack Users</strong>: Multi-hit attacks break through Focus Sash, rendering Archeops useless; Cincinno can shut down Archeops with Rock Blast, while Rhyperior can force mind games with Stealth Rock and Rock Blast.</p>

<p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu can switch into Archeops and bounce Stealth Rock back, but it is heavily damaged by Head Smash.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: After Archeops has fainted, Rapid Spin and Defog users, such as Hitmonlee and Shiftry, respectively, can remove Stealth Rock without much difficulty.</p>

<p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore users such as Whimsicott and Accelgor can cause Archeops to lose momentum if it does not Taunt them first.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Dugtrio might seem like a very mediocre Pokemon at first sight, seeing as how all of its base stats bar Speed are extremely underwhelming. The reason it's viable, though, is its ability Arena Trap, as well as its sufficient movepool consisting of EdgeQuake coverage, priority in Sucker Punch, and supporting options such as Memento. As mentioned, Dugtrio's Speed is high for the RU metagame, being outsped only by Jolteon and Accelgor. Sadly, the same can't be said about its pitiful defenses, and its Attack is very mediocre, not allowing it to do much damage even to Pokemon it's supposed to trap; for example, Dugtrio can never OHKO Cobalion with Earthquake. Despite all of that, Arena Trap is still a good enough ability for Dugtrio to be a viable option in the RU metagame as a trapper aimed at getting rid of certain threats such as Registeel or Drapion in order to support its teammates.</p>

<h1>Trapper </h1>

<div class=set>
    Dugtrio @ Life Orb / Choice Band<br>
    Ability: Arena Trap<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Earthquake<br>- Stone Edge<br>- Sucker Punch<br>- Memento
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Earthquake is Dugtrio's strongest STAB attack, while Stone Edge rounds up its coverage, hitting the Flying-types immune to Earthquake. Sucker Punch is a good priority move, while Memento ensures Dugtrio's teammates have an easier time setting up. Substitute protects Dugtrio from Sucker Punch users such as Skuntank or Houndoom. It also has a use in forcing Support Cobalion to use Close Combat, as it is the only move besides Iron Head (which the set normally doesn't have) that can break Dugtrio's Substitute, lowering Cobalion's defenses and therefore guaranteeing that Dugtrio KOes it.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The set runs a standard offensive spread with a Jolly nature, seeing as Dugtrio's Speed tier is important and it doesn't want to be outsped by anything because it could be KOed by any hit. Life Orb boosts Dugtrio's overall damage output while still allowing it to switch between moves, unlike Choice Band, which has a bit more damage output (for example, it lets Dugtrio 2HKO Rhyperior while Life Orb can't) and no recoil but locks Dugtrio into one move, meaning it can't use Memento after trapping and eliminating a Pokemon. Additionally, it can be easily exploited by Pokemon such as Fletchinder, which is immune to Earthquake and can set up on a Choice-locked Sucker Punch, as well as other Pokemon such as Cresselia and Abomasnow.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Dugtrio can be used throughout the game to trap opposing Pokemon. Even though it has low Attack, it can sweep late-game thanks to its naturally high Speed. The purpose of trapping Pokemon (and therefore, the purpose of Dugtrio) is so that another Pokemon on your team can have an easier time; for example, trapping Registeel and KOing it so that Meloetta can easily sweep or wallbreak. Dugtrio should only be brought in through slow U-turns or Volt Switches, after an ally has been KOed, or with double switches, which can be risky, as Dugtrio's pitiful bulk doesn't allow it to survive anything at all. Finally, use Memento as a last resort move to allow a teammate such as Slurpuff or Feraligatr to set up and sweep.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Slurpuff and Fletchinder both really love Memento support to easily set up, and so do other Pokemon that set up such as Feraligatr and Drapion. Additionally, all of these Pokemon appreciate Dugtrio's support in removing or weakening certain checks and counters, such as Escavalier for Slurpuff and Rhyperior for Fletchinder and Drapion. Tyrantrum works in the same way, as Dugtrio can weaken or KO Steel-types that resist its STAB attacks and support it with Memento should Tyrantrum want to set up. Meloetta and Exploud like the fact that Dugtrio can trap Registeel. Volt Switch and U-turn users are able to bring in Dugtrio safely, so Meloetta, Rotom-C, Eelektross, and Lanturn, among other Pokemon, are good teammates. Meloetta and Dugtrio work especially well together because Meloetta can U-turn on a switch to Registeel and let Dugtrio trap it. Additionally, any Pokemon that likes certain grounded Pokemon either weakened or removed appreciates Dugtrio's support. Finally, Psychic-types that set up with Calm Mind such as Cresselia, Reuniclus, or Meloetta like Dugtrio's ability to weaken or KO Steel-types such as Registeel and Mega Steelix, as well as Drapion, Houndoom, and Skuntank, but Dugtrio can deal with the latter two only when running Substitute, as their Sucker Punch can KO Dugtrio.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Toxic cripples the walls that Dugtrio can trap but not hurt, such as Alomomola or Cresselia, the latter of which is not trapped by Arena Trap and could use Dugtrio to set up. A Stealth Rock set could be used, but it's not advised because there are far better Stealth Rock users, and Dugtrio is better used as a trapper. Reversal is an option, but it needs Focus Sash to function well, which isn't a good item to use on Dugtrio seeing as that it's so weak that it absolutely needs the power boost from Life Orb or Choice Band (for example, it isn't guaranteed to 2HKO Registeel without Life Orb). Substitute is also an option, as it allows Dugtrio to avoid Houndoom and Skuntank's Sucker Punch and KO them with Earthquake the next turn. Finally, Aerial Ace is a usable option, but it should only be used if Dugtrio's team is especially weak to Virizion. Otherwise, STAB Earthquake is still stronger than a 2x super effective Aerial Ace.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: Dugtrio's pitiful bulk doesn't allow it to survive most priority attacks. Therefore, priority move users such as Glalie, Hitmonlee, Fletchinder, and Shiftry can KO it quickly. Priority users should still be wary of Dugtrio's own priority move.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Emboar, Meloetta, Hitmonlee, Rotom-C and anything that's faster than Dugtrio can usually KO it.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Slowking, Amoonguss, Alomomola, Gastrodon, and Cresselia don't take much damage from Dugtrio's attacks and can recover their health easily and beat Dugtrio.</p>

<p><strong>Untrappable Pokemon</strong>: Flying- and Ghost-types, as well as Pokemon with Levitate, can't be trapped by Dugtrio. This means that Cresselia, among other Pokemon, can easily set up on it, while Eelektross, Weezing, Bronzong, and Rotom-C all can't be trapped and are able to take a hit or two from Dugtrio and KO it, or in Weezing's case, burn it or set up Toxic Spikes.</p>

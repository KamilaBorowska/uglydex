<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Thanks to its good Speed and Special Attack, Mismagius is an acceptable choice for an offensive Pokemon in RU. It has access to a variety of support moves to cripple a variety of switch-ins, meaning it is fairly versatile; it also packs several boosting moves, most notably Nasty Plot, that it can use to possibly attempt a sweep. In addition, its Ghost typing allows it to block Rapid Spin. However, this same typing also grants it extremely detrimental weaknesses to popular attacks in Knock Off and Pursuit; these weaknesses are made worse by Mismagius's awful physical bulk. On top of its lack of reliable recovery that prevents it from fully abusing a defensive set, Mismagius ends up leaving much to be desired despite its strengths.</p>

<h1>Nasty Plot</h1>

</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Through the use of Nasty Plot, Mismagius is able to boost its Special Attack to threatening levels. Shadow Ball is used as a reliable STAB move that possesses excellent neutral coverage. Dazzling Gleam is the primary choice as a coverage move, hitting most Dark-types hard, but Thunderbolt deals more damage to neutral foes. From there, it's usually a good idea to take advantage of Mismagius's excellent utility moves. Destiny Bond can be used to take out key Pokemon on the opponent's team, opening up opportunities for a teammate to sweep, and allows Mismagius to function as a strong Drapion lure. Destiny Bond should be used just before a move that is about to KO Mismagius. Alternatively, Taunt is an option to help Mismagius set up on stall Pokemon and prevent most status moves; it should be used when a slower Pokemon is trying to use a non-attacking move. Substitute blocks status, and is additionally useful for getting around Sucker Punch and exploiting switches when an opponent is attempting to sacrifice a Pokemon to deal with Mismagius; it should be used when a status move or Sucker Punch is predicted. Nasty Plot is also viable with three attacking moves.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EVs take advantage of Mismagius's high Speed and allow it to outspeed key threats and deal large amounts of damage after boosts. Life Orb is the preferred item, as even after a Nasty Plot, Shadow Ball's Base Power is still underwhelming, but Spooky Plate is an acceptable alternative if survivability is needed without detracting too much from Mismagius's damage output.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Try to weaken switch-ins with your attacks before boosting up and sweeping, unless these Pokemon are to be eliminated by Destiny Bond. If there are no other alternatives, Sucker Punch users can be played around by stalling out the move's 8 PP. If Mismagius is being used as a spinblocker, be careful of switching into Hitmonlee or Sandslash in particular, as it might use Knock Off instead.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Entry hazards make it easier for Mismagius to sweep, and Mismagius has the added benefit of being able to block attempts to remove these hazards through Rapid Spin thanks to its Ghost typing; Omastar, Rhyperior, and Accelgor are all able to set up hazards fairly reliably. If Destiny Bond is used, Mismagius is a good partner for offensive Psychic-types because it can take out Dark-types. Mismagius's team should be able to deal with Knock Off and Pursuit users; Emboar and Cobalion are capable of repeatedly switching in on most of these Pokemon and forcing them out, which can wear them out in conjunction with hazards. Cobalion and Virizion actually appreciate absorbing Knock Off because it activates Justified; both also enjoy being teammates with a check to opposing bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Mismagius has a plethora of other viable options to mix and match as desired, including Memento, Heal Bell, Icy Wind, Will-O-Wisp (which additionally allows for the viable use of Hex), Thunder Wave, Pain Split, Magic Coat, and Foul Play, but Mismagius already tends to be pressed for moveslots as it is. A set utilizing Taunt + Will-O-Wisp could be difficult for stall teams to handle. A Substitute + Calm Mind set is able to set up on Aromatisse as well as Registeel and Gligar, allowing Mismagius to function as a decent stallbreaker. A bulky support set could be used to take advantage of its support movepool, but Mismagius tends to lack the statistical bulk to run such a set effectively; in addition, its only forms of recovery are the unreliable Pain Split and Rest + Sleep Talk. A Choice Specs set could also utilize Trick to cripple walls while still dealing heavy damage, whereas a Choice Scarf set could pose as a decent revenge killer while utilizing Trick to cripple walls. However, such a set lacks the power to do significant damage to healthy enemies without boosts. A Calm Mind set with three attacks could set up on certain special sweepers more easily, but still leaves Mismagius vulnerable on its already weaker defense. Hidden Power Fire could be used hit Escavalier, but doesn't do much else; similarly, Energy Ball OHKOes Rhyperior before boosts, but otherwise doesn't offer a whole lot. Mismagius lacks the bulk to utilize a Mean Look + Perish Song set effectively under most circumstances.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Powerful Pursuit trappers who can avoid the 2HKO from Mismagius's attacks, such as Skuntank, Spiritomb, and Drapion, are able to put Mismagius in a checkmate position, although they may be crippled by Will-O-Wisp or KOed by Destiny Bond in the process. If Mismagius switches out, it is OHKOed, but if it chooses to stay in, it suffers from a 2HKO instead.</p>

<p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Powerful Knock Off users such as Escavalier are able to hit Mismagius hard for super effective damage on the physical side while crippling it for the rest of the match if the attack doesn't OHKO. However, if they are slower, they will not appreciate Destiny Bond.</p>

<p><strong>Spiritomb</strong>: Spiritomb's ability, Infiltrator, allows it to Pursuit trap Mismagius even when it is behind a Substitute. Spiritomb can also threaten Mismagius severely with Sucker Punch or Shadow Sneak if it chooses to stay in. Spiritomb can be brought down by Mismagius through Destiny Bond, however.</p>

<p><strong>Escavalier</strong>: Assault Vest Escavalier is another notable Mismagius check because it is able to run both Pursuit and Knock Off while taking most of Mismagius's attacks with ease, but it is also taken down by Destiny Bond.</p>

<p><strong>Meloetta</strong>: Meloetta is immune to Shadow Ball and takes pitiful damage from Mismagius's coverage moves, allowing it to wear Mismagius down, but it will not want to be faced with Destiny Bond, either.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong>: Although they will be hard-pressed to switch in, powerful Shadow Sneak users such as Doublade and Mega Banette can revenge kill a weakened Mismagius, provided it isn't behind a Substitute. Mega Banette is also able to utilize a priority Destiny Bond to bring down Mismagius, even if it is behind a Substitute.</p>

<p><strong>Powerful physical attacks</strong>: Powerful neutral physical attacks in general will often be able to overwhelm Mismagius unless the attacker is burned first, but if they are slower, Destiny Bond will be troublesome.</p>

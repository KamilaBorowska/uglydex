<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Omastar finds a unique niche in RU as an excellent support Pokemon for offensive teams thanks to its access to every entry hazard except Sticky Web. Its natural power and good coverage options allow it to hit most Defog users hard; in addition, it is fairly physically bulky, although less so after a Defense drop from Weak Armor. However, Omastar struggles to perform well in other roles because it is very frail specially and is extremely slow. These flaws, as well as its unimpressive match-ups against common Rapid Spin users, leave Omastar far from perfect.</p>

<h1>Suicide Lead</h1>

<div class=set>
    Omastar @ Focus Sash<br>
    Ability: Weak Armor<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Stealth Rock<br>- Spikes<br>- Scald / Hydro Pump<br>- Ice Beam
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Omastar boasts access to every single entry hazard except for Sticky Web, and this set looks to take advantage of this by setting up hazards quickly at the beginning of the match to support hyper offense teams. Thanks to Focus Sash, Omastar is almost always able to get Stealth Rock up unless it is hit by Bullet Seed or Taunted, but if Omastar has more free turns, it is also able to set up Spikes to put even more pressure on the opposing team; alternatively, Spikes can be replaced with Toxic Spikes to weaken certain defensive cores. To avoid becoming setup bait and to further take advantage of Omastar's stellar Special Attack stat, a STAB move is recommended. Scald is the preferred option for the burn chance; however, Hydro Pump offers more raw power in exchange for accuracy. Ice Beam provides decent coverage alongside Omastar's Water-type STAB moves and hits most Defog users hard.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EVs and nature allow Omastar to set up as many entry hazards as possible before fainting while still being able to deal heavy damage to Pokemon that try to remove its hazards. Focus Sash is the preferred item to ensure Omastar is able to set up at least one layer of hazards.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This Omastar variant is best used as a lead to ensure Focus Sash is intact when it is sent into play, and if you are confident in your ability to keep its entry hazards on the field, this Omastar is best played as a suicide lead. However, if the opponent has a Rapid Spinner or Defogger and your team does not have a method to effectively block or discourage it, Omastar can instead be saved for later in the match, but this situation is not ideal and should be avoided in teambuilding.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Omastar is best used on hyper offense teams, which tend not to mind having a member down at the start of the match as much. Hyper offensive teams greatly appreciate the entry hazards and are more able to maintain momentum to prevent the opponent from using Rapid Spin or Defog. To maintain the hazards, a Ghost-type such as Doublade, Mega Banette, or Mismagius helps to block Rapid Spin, while Braviary can discourage the use of Defog by taking advantage of it to gain a Defiant boost; however, most Defog users will be hard-pressed to use it when faced with Omastar's Ice Beam.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Icy Wind can help Omastar set up another layer of hazards by allowing it to outspeed faster Pokemon. Due to its high Special Attack and good coverage options, Omastar can also act as a decent Shell Smash sweeper with a set of Shell Smash / Hydro Pump / Ice Beam / Hidden Power Grass; Ancient Power is its best special Rock-type STAB move, but Ice Beam does the same damage, and Ice Beam and Hidden Power Grass hit more Pokemon super effectively alongside Hydro Pump. Earth Power is an option to OHKO Lanturn after a Shell Smash and 2HKO without, a feat none of Omastar's other attacks can perform, but it has limited uses outside of that. Omastar is one of the best Rain Dance sweepers available, taking advantage of Swift Swim and being able to fire off incredibly powerful Hydro Pumps, but if not used on a dedicated Rain Dance team, Shell Smash is usually better for sweeping. A defensive set is able to take advantage of Omastar's access to hazards, but it is hampered by its lack of reliable recovery. Omastar gets access to Knock Off, but there are far better users of the move available. A physical sweeping set is entirely outclassed by Barbaracle and, to a lesser extent, Kabutops and Carracosta.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Cinccino</strong>: Cinccino is able to cleanly OHKO Omastar with Bullet Seed through its Focus Sash.</p>

<p><strong>Hitmonlee and Hitmontop</strong>: Hitmonlee and Hitmontop are able to bring Omastar down to its Focus Sash with their STAB Fighting-type moves. They can then either follow up with Rapid Spin to KO Omastar while removing the entry hazards it has set or use Mach Punch if Omastar chose to attack on the first turn.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers that can outspeed and 2HKO Omastar will prevent it from setting up more than one layer of entry hazards, but they must be wary of being hit hard by one of Omastar's attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Powerful physical attackers that are able to outspeed +1 Omastar and 2HKO it can also prevent it from setting up more than one layer of entry hazards, but they also must be careful of simply being attacked.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Hitmontop is a great Pokemon, having incredible bulk and access to Intimidate. In addition, it has access to Rapid Spin and has a decent offensive presence with base 95 Attack, as well as access to priority with Sucker Punch, allowing it to pick off weakened foes. It also has a move that most Rapid Spin users yearn for, Foresight, which prevents identified Ghost-types from spinblocking. However, Defog now removes hazards from both sides of the field, which makes Hitmontop harder to fit onto a team as it faces competition from Pokemon such as Gligar and Golbat.</p>

<h1>Rapid Spin</h1>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin is obviously the most important move, allowing Hitmontop to remove entry hazards from your side of the field. Close Combat prevents Hitmontop from being total Taunt bait, and also serves as its STAB attack.Foresight is the preferred move in the third slot, as it allows Hitmontop to use Rapid Spin and Close Combat on Ghost-type Pokemon unless they have two of them. Even though it's not useful in every game, it can almost always get entry hazards off your side of the field. Without it, Hitmontop finds it extremely difficult to do its job as Ghost-types such as Doublade, Jellicent, and Mega Banette are extremely common. Toxic is used in the last slot and allows Hitmontop to put a timer on deadly sweepers and walls such as Alomomola and Druddigon. Counter may be used over Toxic if Hitmontop is being used on a Toxic Spikes stall team, as Counter gives Hitmontop the capability to quickly remove powerful physical attackers such as Escavalier and Durant in one turn, which is can't do with Close Combat. </p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EVs with an Impish nature maximizes Hitmontop's physical bulk. When combined with Intimidate, most physical attackers have a hard time taking Hitmontop down. Leftovers complement Hitmontop's physical bulk, allowing it to heal damage it might have taken from entry hazards or status such as burn and poison.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Switch into physical attackers that Hitmontop can deal with such as Cobalion, physical Sharpedo, and opposing Hitmontop. However, be careful when you see a Ghost-type on your opponent's team. If you predict them switching in, use Foresight so you can use Rapid Spin, or Toxic to wear them down. However, bear in mind that if your opponent has two Ghost-types, it will not be able to use Rapid Spin easily. Note that Hitmontop can easily switch into many of the prominent physical attackers in the tier, thanks to Intimidate. Do not try to switch Hitmontop into super effective special attacks, as they will hurt a lot, and will most likely KO it. Lastly, try not to get Hitmontop inflicted with status because it has no way of curing it, thus getting worn down really easily.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Hitmontop is great on balanced and stall-based teams that use their own entry hazards and appreciate a bulky spinner. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal such as Fletchinder, Moltres, and Delphox make good partners. Psychic-types such as Bronzong and Slowking make great partners because they can switch into Psychic-type moves aimed at it, and in return, Hitmontop can take on the Dark-type moves directed at them. In addition, Dark-types such as Shiftry and Sharpedo make great partners, taking out the Ghost-types that prevent Hitmontop from using Rapid Spin, and can switch in on the Psychic-type moves aimed at Hitmontop. However, they all share the same Fairy-type weakness. Cleric support from Audino and Aromatisse makes them fantastic partners, as they can cure status and pass huge Wishes to improve Hitmontop's longevity.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Stone Edge may be used on Hitmontop in order to keep Moltres and Fletchinder, among other Flying-types, from switching in on Hitmontop too easily. Sucker Punch is also a viable coverage move and priority attack that allows Hitmontop to pick off weakened Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Mismagius and Meloetta. Hitmontop can also run an Assault Vest set, but it gets worn down very easily, and loses two ways of getting past Ghost-types: Foresight and Toxic. Earthquake can be used to hit most Poison-types such as Skuntank and Amoonguss for at least neutral damage, but it's really hard to find a moveslot for it. Aerial Ace can be used to KO Virizion and other common Pokemon in the tier, though it has little use other than that. High Jump Kick can be used to deal massive amounts of damage, but sadly, Hitmontop loses half of its HP upon missing, and is outclassed by Hitmonlee, which sports higher Attack and Speed, as an attacker. Mach Punch can be used as another form of priority, although Sucker Punch is generally better since it gives Hitmontop a way to hit Psychic-types that fill the tier. Technician can be used as an ability, but Hitmontop is outclassed in offensive roles and Intimidate is one of the only reasons to use it.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Slowking can easily switch into Hitmontop and force it out with their powerful STABmoves.</p>

<p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Granbull can switch into Hitmontop's moves with ease and force it out with their STAB attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such Mismagius and Cofagrigus can make it difficult for Hitmontop to get its job done, as they can block Rapid Spin, and most of them have access to Will-O-Wisp as well.</p>

<p><strong>Weezing</strong>: Weezing can take any move Hitmontop has and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp. It can also wear down Hitmontop with its own attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Since Hitmontop has no access to reliable recovery or any way to cure status, it will be worn down easily if afflicted with status.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>At first glance, Kricketune appears to be a horrific Pokemon. With terrible defenses, barely any offensive presence, and low Speed that makes it susceptible to Taunt, you aren't to blame if you find Kricketune underwhelming. However, for Kricketune, there is light at the end of the tunnel. This is because Kricketune has access to Sticky Web, a valuable move in the RU metagame due to the abundance of slower Pokemon. Alongside this, with access to the combination of Taunt and Endeavor, Kricketune can force a surprise KO at the beginning of the match. Taunt is also great for Kricketune as it is one of the main reasons to use it over Leavanny, which has Magic Coat in addition to Sticky Web. Kricketune's access to Knock Off also provides good utility, as it makes it a little tricky for opposing Pokemon to switch into Kricketune, as no Pokemon wants to lose its item.</p>

<h1>DELELELEWHOOP (Sticky Web)</h1>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Sticky Web slows down each grounded opponent that switches in, allowing slower Pokemon on your team to outspeed them. Taunt is a good move on Kricketune, as not only does Kricketune outspeed most Defoggers and be able to Taunt them, it forces the opponent to attack Kricketune, and with Kricketune's frail defenses, bring Kricketune all the way to 1 HP, allowing Kricketune to return the favor with Endeavor. Knock Off is used to cripple opposing Pokemon by taking away their items. This also works well with using Taunt on Defoggers as most Defoggers are not fully evolved and rely on their Eviolite.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>A Focus Sash is used for multiple reasons. First, it guarantees that Kricketune can set up Sticky Web. Second, it lets Kricketune bring the opponent down to 1 HP with Endeavor after Kricketune has been hit. 252 Attack EVs simply boost the power of Knock Off, as there is no real reason to invest in bulk when Kricketune usually relies on being frail enough to be taken down to 1 HP. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature maximize Kricketune's Speed, allowing it to outspeed as many Defoggers as possible after they switch into Sticky Web.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Kricketune usually likes to set up Sticky Web before anything else, which is why it is usually your first priority. Kricketune is best used as a suicide lead after it sets up Sticky Web and uses Endeavor when it's low on HP to cripple opponents. Taunt is especially important to prevent possible setup sweepers from setting up boosts or entry hazard leads from setting up hazards. Kricketune should try to stay alive during the match, as it can come in later and cripple defensive Pokemon, such as Alomomola, with Endeavor.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Slower teammates that can outspeed a lot of the tier after Sticky Web such as Hitmonlee, Meleotta, Drapion, Exploud, Clawitzer, Gallade, and Emboar are good teammates. Maximum Speed Druddigon also appreciates the opponent's drop in Speed and can set up Stealth Rock as well. Spinblockers such as Doublade and Banette can help preserve Sticky Web. Spiritomb can spinblock too, as well as check Meleotta, a huge threat. Braviary especially is a good partner as it appreciates the opponents' drop in Speed, and can switch into Defog to gain a free Defiant boost. Pokemon such as Jolteon, Choice Scarf Rotom-C, and Moltres also work as good offensive partners if Sticky Web is removed.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Kricketune is really not advised to use anything apart from the set listed, as all of its other sets are outclassed by its lead set. However, if need be, Kricketune can run a Swords Dance set with Bug Bite / Knock Off / Sticky Web with Technician as the ability. Toxic can also be used to cripple switch-ins, but Kricketune fails to find the space for it.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Taunt</strong>: If Kricketune is taunted by faster users of Taunt such as Coballion or Qwilfish, it can't make use of its one niche, Sticky Web. Coballion can not only Taunt, but doesn't worry much about Knock Off either, as it gains a Justified boost from it. </p>

<p><strong>Defog</strong>: Defog users such as Gligar can come in on Kricketune's teammates and get rid of Sticky Web.</p>

<p><strong>Rapid Spin</strong>: Kricketune is outsped by most Rapid Spinners and is OHKOed by most of them as well. Sandslash can beat most spinblockers as well, and it isn't hurt much by Sticky Web as it usually invests in bulk, which is why it is an even bigger threat for Kricketune.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-Hit Attacks</strong>: Multi-hit attacks can break through Kricketune's Focus Sash and prevent it from crippling opponents with Endeavor. Cincinno gets a special mention as it also outspeeds Kricketune and stops from using Sticky Web too.</p>

<p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu has Magic Bounce and stops Kricketune from setting up Sticky Web,; however, it somewhat fears Knock Off.</p>

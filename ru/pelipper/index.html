<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Pelipper sports a decent defensive typing that gives it a plethora of resistances which is backed up with good defensive stats. It also has access to reliable recovery in Roost, as well as Defog, which allows it to remove entry hazards from both sides of the battlefield. It even has U-turn, which allows it to escape dangerous threats and maintain momentum. However, Pelipper has a 4x weakness to Electric-type moves and is also weak to Stealth Rock, which gives it a somewhat hard time using Defog effectively. In addition, its offenses are mediocre, and it is quite slow.</p>

<h1>Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Pelipper @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Keen Eye<br>
    EVs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD<br>
    Bold Nature<br>
    - Scald<br>- Roost<br>- Defog<br>- U-turn / Air Slash
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Scald serves as the primary STAB attack, and it's very good on Pelipper because the burn rate gives physical attackers a harder time taking it down. Roost provides reliable recovery, and lets Pelipper heal off damage it might have taken from Stealth Rock or status. Defog was buffed in XY and now removes entry hazards from both sides of the field, so it is a great move on a defensive Pokemon such as Pelipper. The last move is a toss-up. U-turn is used to gain momentum and escape dangerous threats, and should be used on more balanced teams. However, Air Slash can also be used as a secondary STAB attack to hit Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Roselia that try to switch into Scald, and should be used on more defensive teams for the utility that it provides.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EVs with a Bold nature maximize Pelipper's physical bulk, and give it a Stealth Rock number for more switch-ins. Leftovers is used to provide some passive recovery. Keen Eye is the only ability that should be used, because Rain Dish is incompatible with Defog.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Use Roost sparingly, as against stall-based teams, it will be very important. Switch into Pokemon that Pelipper can check or counter, such as Escavalier and Poliwrath, and proceed to use Defog if you need entry hazards removed. In addition, use Scald often for its burn chance, which can help Pelipper remove hazards more easily and cushion physical attacks for its teammates, or use U-turn to keep momentum.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Defensive Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Roselia, and Amoonguss have excellent synergy with Pelipper, and can take on Electric-type attacks aimed at Pelipper, while Pelipper can switch into Bug- and Fire-type attacks aimed at them, as well as taking on most Ice-type attacks. Pokemon who appreciate entry hazard removal, such as Delphox and Abomasnow, make good partners. Pelipper really appreciates cleric support from Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Aromatisse as it has no way of removing status and is worn down quickly by it.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>An offensive set with Hydro Pump and Hurricane can be used, but due to Pelipper's average Special Attack, it won't do much, and is outclassed by other Water-types such as Clawitzer, Slowking, and Sharpedo. Rain Dance can also be used, but it is not very useful. The ability Rain Dish can be used as well, but weather is uncommon, and it is incompatible with Defog, which is one of the only reasons you should use it over another Water-type Pokemon. Tailwind is another interesting choice, and can be used to increase the Speed of its team. Lastly, Knock Off can be used, but it is extremely weak.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Electric-types</strong> Electric-types such as Rotom-C, Jolteon, and Magneton can trouble Pelipper because of its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves, and canmaintain momentum with Volt Switch while forcing Pelipper out.</p>

<p><strong>Rock-types</strong> Rock-types such as Tyrantrum and Rhyperior can check Pelipper and force it out with their strong STAB attacks, but fear the burn from Scald.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong> Status such as burn and poison wear Pelipper down quickly.</p>

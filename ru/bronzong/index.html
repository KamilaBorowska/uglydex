<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Bronzong's neat defensive typing grants it nine resistances and an immunity, and when coupled with its solid bulk and a great movepool turns it into a great defensive or support Pokemon. Bronzong's nice ability, Levitate, grants it immunity to otherwise super effective Ground-type attacks and prevents it from being trapped by Dugtrio. Although its low Speed allows it to have a more powerful Gyro Ball and take advantage of Trick Room, this also means that it will be taking more hits due to it moving after most opponents. The ubiquity of Knock Off is also detrimental to Bronzong, due to Knock Off hitting it super effectively, unlike other Steel-types, such as Registeel, which it faces competition from. A lack of reliable recovery also somewhat hampers Bronzong's defensive capabilities, leaving it slightly outclassed by some other walls such as Cresselia.</p>

<h1>Specially Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Bronzong @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Levitate<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD<br>
    Sassy Nature<br>
    - Stealth Rock / Protect<br>- Gyro Ball<br>- Earthquake<br>- Toxic
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Bronzong can easily find opportunities to set up Stealth Rock with its plethora of resistances and solid natural bulk. Protect can be used in this slot for racking up Toxic damage and regaining some HP from Leftovers if a teammate can set up Stealth Rock. Gyro Ball is easily Bronzong's strongest STAB move, and is powered up by its low Speed. Earthquake hits Fire-types which resist Gyro Ball for a decent amount of damage. Toxic can cripple switch-ins and wear them down so teammates can break past them easier.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Sassy nature makes Bronzong as bulky on the special side as possible, and 0 Speed IVs ensure Gyro Ball has as much power as possible. Levitate is an overall better ability than Heatproof, and allows Bronzong to wall Rhyperior to some extent. Leftovers is used to provide some residual recovery.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Bronzong can switch in many times throughout a match thanks to its solid bulk, an immunity to Spikes and Toxic, and a resistance to Stealth Rock. Taunt cripples Bronzong to some degree, so make sure to keep it away from potential Taunt users. Bronzong also forces quite a few switches, so take advantage of this and use Toxic often.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Wish passers such as Aromatisse help greatly, due to Bronzong having no real recovery outside of Leftovers. Physically defensive walls such as Alomomola and Drapion also work well with Bronzong, soaking up both physical and special hits together. Setup sweepers such as Rhyperior can also take advantage of the many switches Bronzong forces. Knock Off absorbers, such as Cobalion which also gets a Justified boost, aid Bronzong in staying alive and supporting its team.</p>

<h1>Offensive Trick Room</h1>

<div class=set>
    Bronzong @ Normal Gem / Mental Herb<br>
    Ability: Levitate<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def<br>
    Brave Nature<br>
    - Trick Room<br>- Stealth Rock<br>- Gyro Ball / Earthquake<br>- Explosion
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Trick Room is easily set up unless the opponent is a fast Taunt user and setting up Stealth Rock is almost guaranteed after that. Gyro Ball hits quite hard due to Bronzong's low Speed, and hits most Taunt users for heavy damage while preventing Bronzong from being completely shut down by Taunt. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used to hit opposing Steel-types and Fire-types, which resist Gyro Ball. Explosion allows Bronzong to literally go out with a bang, dealing heavy damage to anything that doesn't resist it and preventing opponents from Rapid Spinning or Defogging away Stealth Rock.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum HP and Attack EVs with a Relaxed nature let Bronzong tank hits pretty comfortably and retaliate hard, while Levitate grants it an immunity to Ground-type moves. Normal Gem allows Explosion to hit extremely hard, but a Mental Herb can be used to guarantee the setup of Trick Room, and, by extension, Stealth Rock.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This Bronzong should typically be used as a suicide lead to set up Trick Room and Stealth Rock in order to assist some slower sweepers. Use Trick Room, Stealth Rock, and Explosion in that order, as Earthquake and Gyro Ball should only be used if the opponent carries Taunt. If there is a Ghost-type on the opponent's team, switch Bronzong out and save it to use Explosion later and possibly chunk an opposing wall.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Slower sweepers such as Escavalier and Exploud can benefit from Trick Room and perform their roles even better. Phazers can continue forcing the opponent's Pokemon to take residual damage.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>A Calm Mind set can be used with Flash Cannon and Psychic, but it is generally outclassed by other Calm Mind users. A weather-setting move such as Sunny Day or Rain Dance can be used to support the team. Trick in combination with Lagging Tail or Toxic Orb can be fun to play around with. Hidden Power Ice is situational, but can be used to dent Gligar and other Grass-, Flying-, and Ground-type threats.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt shuts down Bronzong, preventing it from utilizing its support moves and forcing it out in most cases.</p>

<p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu's Magic Bounce ability prevents Bronzong from using Stealth Rock or any status moves, effectively forcing it to attack or switch out.</p>

<p><strong>Doublade</strong>: Doublade can set up Swords Dance on Bronzong with ease, benefits from Trick Room, and isn't really affected by anything Bronzong can do.</p>

<p><strong>Reuniclus</strong>: Reuniclus also benefits from Trick Room, can set up Calm Mind, and doesn't take damage from Toxic due to its Magic Guard ability.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Moltres in particular does not really fear anything from Bronzong except for Toxic or Explosion, due to its resistance to Gyro Ball and immunity to Earthquake. Other Fire-types must watch out for Earthquake, but once they come in they can force Bronzong out with a strong STAB move.</p>

<p><strong>Slowking and Clawitzer</strong> Slowking and Clawitzer do not fear much except for Toxic, but they can either force Bronzong out with a super effective coverage move or wear it down with Scald burns.</p>

<p><strong>Spiritomb</strong> Spiritomb can trap Bronzong and ignore its screens with Infiltrator, while easily taking anything Bronzong has to hit it with.</p>

<p><strong>Escavalier</strong> Escavalier takes almost nothing from any of Bronzong's attacks and can easily threaten it out with Knock Off or set up on it.</p>

<p><strong>Eelektross</strong>: Eelektross is immune to Earthquake thanks to Levitate, and it also resists Gyro Ball due to its Electric typing. It can then force Bronzong out with Knock Off or Flamethrower, or gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p>

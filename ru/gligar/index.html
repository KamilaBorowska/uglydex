<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Gligar finds a nice spot in RU as one of the premier entry hazard removers and physical walls. This is because of its immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and neutrality to Stealth Rock, which allow it to come in and remove hazards with ease with Defog. It also has a great defensive typing that, when backed by Eviolite and Roost, makes Gligar very hard to take down. Gligar is also one of the best answers to Pokemon such as Hitmonlee, Rhyperior, and Escavalier in the tier, as it walls their standard sets. Unfortunately for Gligar, it has a low base Attack stat, meaning it's often setup fodder for the likes of Calm Mind Cresselia and Bulk Up Braviary. Its defensive typing also gives it weaknesses to common Water- and Ice-type attacks, and when combined with its average special bulk, leaves it weak to a good amount of the special attackers in the tier. It's also not very hard to wear Gligar down, as even with its entry hazard resistances, it lacks the ability to heal through Leftovers. Finally, Gligar suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it really wants to run Defog, Stealth Rock, Roost, Earthquake, U-turn, Toxic, and Knock Off all on the same set.</p>

<h1>Physically Defensive</h1>

<div class=set>
    Gligar @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Hyper Cutter / Immunity<br>
    EVs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD<br>
    Impish Nature<br>
    - Defog / Stealth Rock<br>- Earthquake<br>- Roost<br>- Toxic / Knock Off / U-turn
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Defog is used in the first slot as it is a great support move that allows Gligar to remove hazards for its team with ease. Earthquake allows Gligar to do decent damage to the opponent and makes sure it's not complete Taunt bait. Roost is used in the third slot for reliable recovery, something necessary for a defensive Pokemon lacking Leftovers such as Gligar. Toxic is an option for the fourth slot on a more defensive team, as it allows Gligar to rack up residual damage nicely. Knock Off is another helpful option, however, for crippling Pokemon such as Doublade, Golbat, and opposing Gligar. It should be noted, however, that using Knock Off will weaken a teammate's Knock Off should it decide to Knock Off the same Pokemon. U-turn can also be used to help Gligar gain momentum for more balanced teams. Stealth Rock, while not on the set, is another option for the fourth slot, as Gligar can remove hazards and then immediately set up its own again.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EV spread with an Impish nature provides as much physical bulk as possible while minimizing hazard damage, making Gligar hard to take down. Eviolite is used to further boost Gligar's physical bulk while also increasing its special bulk by a fair amount. Immunity is sadly illegal with Defog, making Hyper Cutter the only option for an ability when using the move. However, if Gligar chooses to run Stealth Rock over Defog, Immunity can be used freely.</p>

<hr />

<p>Gligar is a pretty easy Pokemon to use, as its job is quite simple. Switch it into something it can wall, use one of its support options or attack, and switch it out once your opponent has brought in a Pokemon that threatens Gligar. It's important to keep Gligar as healthy as possible at all times, as it can find itself getting worn down quite easily without Leftovers. While Knock Off does cripple Gligar, it's usually fine to let Pokemon such as Hitmonlee Knock Off its Eviolite, as Gligar will still wall Hitmonlee. However, this does not mean that Gligar should or can be switched into Knock Off at random.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Specially defensive Drapion can phaze setup sweepers with Whirlwind, spread Toxic Spikes to cripple counters, and stop Calm Mind users with Taunt + Knock Off, making it a great teammate. Specially defensive Aromatisse can also cure status for Gligar. Amoonguss can deal with Electric-types that tend to carry coverage moves that hit Gligar super effectively, while Bronzong can set up Stealth Rock and help spread status. Gligar is a great counter to Fighting-types, meaning Rhyperior, Registeel, and Lickilicky appreciate it's ability to wall them. Pokemon that can reliably take Ice- and Water-type attacks for Gligar such as Slowking and Jellicent make for helpful partners. Pokemon that appreciate Defog support such as Fletchinder, Moltres, and Delphox appreciate Gligar's ability to remove hazards. Gligar hates Knock Off, making Cobalion a helpful partner as it can absorb Knock Off relatively well and benefit from it thanks to Justified.</p>

<h1>Swords Dance + Baton Pass</h1>

<div class=set>
    Gligar @ Eviolite<br>
    Ability: Immunity<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br>
    Impish Nature<br>
    - Swords Dance<br>- Baton Pass<br>- Roost<br>- Earthquake
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Swords Dance allows Gligar to double its Attack and pass it on to incoming teammates with Baton Pass. Roost is a source of reliable recovery, which ensures that Gligar is not worn down too easily, and can accumulate a few more boosts and Baton Pass effectively. Earthquake is Gligar's reliable STAB attack, giving it some offensive presence if it needs to utilize the boosts itself. Earthquake also helps to beat threatening Taunt users, such as Drapion and Cobalion. Agility can be used with an alternate spread for when Gligar wants to pass to a slower threat that needs a bit of extra Speed to sweep, while Substitute can be used to pass a Substitute to a frail sweeper to guarantee it survives a hit from the opposing Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>252 EVs in HP and Defense, an Impish nature, Eviolite, and 4 EVs in Special Defense give some bulk to Gligar and allow it to take hits while boosting, even acting as a strong physical wall. Gligar is not invested in Speed, which allows it to slowly pass accumulated boosts and bring its teammates in safely. A spread with a Relaxed nature and 9 Speed IVs can be used to just underspeed Alomomola, ensuring that the incoming physical attacker will not be taking a Scald or Toxic. An alternate spread with Speed investment can be run to ensure Gligar outpaces some Taunt users and can pass Agility and Substitute more efficiently.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Gligar can come in on most Fighting-, Poison-, and Steel-types, such as Hitmonlee, Skuntank, and Cobalion, and begin setting up. Remove all immediate threats to Gligar before setting up, such as Pokemon with Ice-type moves, or Water-types such as Slowking. Thanks to its bulk, Gligar can set up numerous times, and because it is uninvested in Speed, it makes for a great relatively slow Baton Pass user to get Pokemon in unscathed. Finally, Gligar should pass boosts to faster Pokemon such as Sharpedo, Drapion, and Cobalion, and Shiftry, as otherwise, the Pokemon receiving the boosts might be easily outsped and revenge killed.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Gligar functions well in tandem with fast physical sweepers, such as Cobalion and Sharpedo, as they appreciate the Attack boosts and can effectively sweep through opposing teams. Gligar also effectively walls Fighting-types for both Cobalion and Sharpedo, and is immune to Ground for Cobalion, and Electric for Sharpedo. Drapion works well in tandem with Gligar, as Gligar is immune to Drapion's sole weakness, Ground, and Drapion is a nice Baton Pass receiver with its good Speed. Water-types such as Slowking and Clawitzer work well with Gligar, as Gligar is immune to Electric-type attacks, and they can take Ice- and Water-type moves for it in return. Lastly, Shiftry is a good teammate, as it appreciates Gligar's ability to take Bug-, Fighting-, and Poison-type moves for it, and also makes good use of boosts that Gligar could pass to it. Shiftry also resists Water-type moves which Gligar is weak to, so it can take those hits for it; furthermore, with Shiftry's immunity to Psychic-type moves, it is a great Pokemon to Baton Pass to if Gligar is threatened out by Slowking.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Stone Edge can be used for hitting Flying-types, though it's generally not very powerful, and most Flying-types can Roost off the damage. Acrobatics is an option for hitting Virizion that is decently powerful if Gligar loses its Eviolite, but does nothing outside of this. As Gligar can take on most physical attackers, Counter can be used to catch these Pokemon off-guard, though the moves on the set are usually better. If you're not using Defog for whatever reason, Immunity is a great ability to stop Toxic, though Defog is the main reason to use Gligar in the first place. Tailwind is an interesting option on more balanced teams, speeding up powerful attackers. However, it only lasts for three turns and is usually outclassed by the options on the set. Finally, Baton Pass in conjunction with Swords Dance or Agility can be used, though Smash Pass Gorebyss and Combusken are usually better Baton Pass users.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Cresselia, Shell Smash Gorebyss, Bulk Up Braviary, and Hone Claws Durant have no trouble using Gligar as setup fodder due to its weak Attack stat. However, Toxic can wear some of these threats down.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Abomasnow</strong>: Mega Abomasnow can switch into Earthquake with ease and threatens Gligar with its STAB Blizzard. Hail damage from Snow Warning is also very annoying for the latter.</p>

<p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Clawitzer, Jellicent, Gastrodon, Slowking, and Samurott all have no trouble taking Gligar out with a STAB Water-type attack. Knock Off and Toxic can potentially cripple them, however.</p>

<p><strong>Flying-types / Levitate</strong>: Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate such as Golbat, Rotom-C, and Cresselia take no damage from Earthquake and are only affected by Toxic and Knock Off.</p>

<p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Choice Specs Exploud and Moltres have an easy time targeting Gligar's weaker Special Defense stat.</p>

<p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off from the likes of Drapion and Escavalier can cripple Gligar, though it can wall other Pokemon effectively even without its Eviolite.</p>

<p><strong>Braviary</strong>: Braviary can switch in on Defog and receive a +2 Attack boost from Defiant. However, it needs Choice Band, Life Orb, or Bulk Up in order to break Gligar, as Gligar can otherwise simply stall Braviary out with Roost.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Despite its NFE status, Vullaby finds its way onto various defensive teams in NU by virtue of its good defensive stats and typing. It boasts an excellent support movepool which includes Defog, Whirlwind, and Knock Off. However, Vullaby's lack of offensive presence means that it should only be used on defensive teams that benefit from its ability to check a variety of Grass-, Psychic-, and Dark-types.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Vullaby's main role on a team is to clear entry hazards with Defog. Roost keeps Vullaby healthy and Foul Play gives it a consistent way to deal damage. The move in the last slot should be tailored to your team's needs. Toxic is useful for wearing down Pokemon that don't take too much damage from Foul Play, and it can be used to stall out various threats. Whirlwind is also an option if your team is weak to boosting sweepers, such as Lilligant and Uxie. However, since Vullaby's goal is to clear hazards, Whirlwind's utility will be limited to forcing these Pokemon out. Knock Off is also a viable option to remove the opponent's item, but rarely will it outdamage Foul Play.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>A specially defensive spread is used as Vullaby's typing is more suited to walling Psychic- and Grass-types, which are usually specially offensive. Eviolite is an obvious choice for the item. If using Knock Off, be sure to switch the nature from Calm to Careful.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Although Vullaby takes negligible damage from Knock Off, it is generally not a good idea to let it get hit by the move, as without Eviolite it will become considerably frailer. Also, because it lacks Leftovers recovery unlike other Defoggers such as Pelipper and Mantine, it is more vulnerable to residual damage such as Stealth Rock, so try not to play Vullaby too aggressively.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Vullaby is best used in a defensive core or on stall teams. Defensive Granbull can provide Heal Bell support and also counter Fighting-types, which demolish Vullaby. Flareon can take special attacks such as Ice Beam and Thunderbolt very well, and Flareon also provides Heal Bell support while appreciating Stealth Rock being removed.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Taunt is an option to completely shut down slower Pokemon such as Audino, Ferroseed, and Musharna, but Vullaby is too slow to make good use of the move. U-turn can be used to gain momentum, but defensive teams do not value momentum as much. Brave Bird hits certain threats such as Lilligant and Vileplume harder than Foul Play, but is extremely weak if it does not hit something super effectively. Finally, a physically defensive spread is an option to handle physical attackers such as Zangoose and Rhydon better.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Ice- and Electric-type moves</strong>: Most of these are specially based and can be stalled with Roost because Vullaby is faster, but Foul Play won't be doing too much to special attackers so Vullaby will usually come out on the losing end.</p>

<p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Vullaby takes huge damage from Rock-type moves, but Rock-types will have to watch out for Foul Play as it can deal a nice chunk of damage to most of them.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types resist Foul Play and can hit Vullaby hard. Slower ones such as Gurdurr and Hariyama will prevent Vullaby from Roosting.</p>

<p><strong>Granbull</strong>: Granbull resists Foul Play and can destroy Vullaby with Play Rough. </p>

<p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knocking Off Vullaby's Eviolite will greatly reduce its longevity.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Poison and burn will make Vullaby's job a lot harder as it does not utilize Leftovers.</p>

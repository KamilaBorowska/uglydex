<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Rotom-F's excellent Ice / Electric STAB combination provides great coverage, and when used in combination with its decent special stats and Speed, makes it a great late-game cleaner and early-game scout. Rotom-F's access to Volt Switch and Trick allows it to run both Choice Scarf and Choice Specs sets quite well, and its Levitate ability along with its handy paralysis immunity gives it many switch-in opportunities. Unfortunately, Rotom-F's secondary Ice typing comes with weaknesses to common attacking types such as Fighting, Rock, and Fire, meaning that Pokemon such as Sawk, Pyroar, and Gurdurr can usually force it out. Its low base HP also means that it can be worn down very easily.</p>

<h1>Choice Scarf</h1>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-F to act as a fast scout when holding a Choice Scarf, pivoting in and out while outspeeding the whole unboosted tier. Blizzard acts as Rotom-F's Ice-type STAB move, hitting anything that doesn't resist it extremely hard. Thunderbolt gives Rotom-F effective BoltBeam coverage, hitting the entire tier for at least neutral damage in combination with Blizzard. Trick is Rotom-F's best bet to cripple special walls such as Audino, locking them into a move to give teammates setup opportunities and prevent walls from supporting their team.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>A Timid nature along with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Rotom-F to hit as hard and fast as possible, notably outspeeding Jolly Sawk even after Rotom-F has Tricked away its Choice Scarf. Choice Scarf lets Rotom-F outspeed the whole unboosted tier and act as a fast pivot or scout to gain offensive momentum.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Rotom-F's ability to threaten most Ground-types with its STAB Blizzard discourages them from switching in to absorb Volt Switch, giving it ample opportunities to keep or gain offensive momentum, but be wary that a mispredicted switch could lead to forfeiting all your momentum. Thunderbolt can be used to clean up late-game when Grass- and Ground-types have been removed, but be cautious of using it when the opponent has switch-ins to Electric-type moves. Trick should only be used when absolutely necessary, such as on Audino if your team has trouble with it, as the Choice Scarf may come in handy early-game.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Spinners and Defoggers are necessary for Rotom-F to continue pivoting effectively, due to Stealth Rock limiting its Volt Switch shenanigans. Spikes or Stealth Rock users of your own such as Garbodor and Ferroseed can be helpful to whittle down opposing Pokemon as they are forced out. Sweepers like Feraligatr and Gurdurr that can set up on Pokemon that Rotom-F lures in, such as Rhydon, can benefit greatly from the free setup opportunity.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Rotom-F has many alternative options, such as a Life Orb all-out attacking set, a Choice Specs set, a defensive ChestoRest set, and even an Assault Vest set. Some other options in terms of moves include Will-O-Wisp to cripple Piloswine, which completely walls most Rotom-F variants, Hidden Power Grass and Fire to hit Seismitoad and Ferroseed respectively, Pain Split for a form of HP recovery, and even Hidden Power Ice over Blizzard for those who are scared of missing.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Piloswine</strong>: Piloswine can switch into any Rotom-F lacking Will-O-Wisp, due to an immunity to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt and a resistance to Blizzard thanks to its Thick Fat ability. Piloswine kills Rotom-F's momentum and forces it out, and Piloswine it can set up Stealth Rock to further punish it.</p>

<p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Audino and specially defensive Flareon can shrug off most of Rotom-F's attacks and cripple it with status, but they don't appreciate Trick from the Choice Scarf set.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-, Rock-, and Fighting-types</strong>: These Pokemon can either take advantage of a Choice-locked Rotom-F and proceed to dent it with a super effective STAB move or revenge kill it.</p>

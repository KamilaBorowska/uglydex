<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Chatot has access to powerful attacks in Chatter, which always causes confusion, and Boomburst, both of which hit through Substitute. Chatot also has a decent Speed stat that notably allows it to outspeed Sawk, Lilligant, and Zangoose. Unfortunately, Chatot lacks Heat Wave due to its incompatibility to have both it and Boomburst on the same set, and Chatot's frailness and mediocre typing are easily taken advantage of due to its common weaknesses to Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type moves.</p>

<h1>Substitute</h1>

<div class=set>
    Chatot @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Keen Eye<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Substitute<br>- Encore / Nasty Plot<br>- Boomburst<br>- Chatter
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Substitute allows Chatot to scout moves and Choice items, and Encore discourages the opponent from setting up by locking foes into the same move, potentially allowing Chatot to safely use its other attacks. However, Nasty Plot works wonderfully as an aid for wallbreaking or sweeping, allowing Chatot to take advantage of the power and effects behind its STAB attacks. Boomburst is a nuke, sporting 140 Base Power and perfect accuracy, allowing it to nail frail Pokemon and hit walls hard. Chatter has the added effect of guaranteeing confusion if it hits, allowing Chatot to force switches and severely hinder bulky Pokemon.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Chatot cannot really take advantage of its abilities, so Keen Eye is the standard one and, while not really useful in common situations, allows Chatot to avoid accuracy drops from random moves. Leftovers aids in letting Chatot make more Substitutes and prolonging its lifespan. An odd HP number gives it another Substitute and another switch into Stealth Rock. A Timid nature allows Chatot to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Zangoose and Lilligant.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Take advantage of the utility its moves bring to maximize Chatot's effectiveness: Chatter's guaranteed confusion chance and Boomburst's power cause many switches. Chatot can either set up early in the match and wallbreak for its teammates or sweep late-game with a Nasty Plot boost. Sticky Web aids in the latter role, slowing down glass cannons and revenge killers in order for Chatot to keep sweeping.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that take care of the bulky Rock- and Steel-types that can stomach Chatot's attacks are appreciated. Fighting-types such as Sawk, Primeape, and Hariyama are great for this role, as they can also aid Chatot in wallbreaking and sweeping later on. Setting up entry hazards is important due to the many switches Chatot is able to cause. Seismitoad and Ferroseed can set up hazards and also resist the Rock- and Electric-type moves that Chatot is weak to. Finally, Rapid Spin support to keep Stealth Rock off the field makes sure that it does not strip Chatot of health every time it comes in.</p>

<h1>Choice</h1>

<div class=set>
    Chatot @ Choice Specs / Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Keen Eye<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Boomburst<br>- Chatter<br>- U-turn<br>- Hidden Power Ground
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Boomburst is a powerful STAB move that rips frail Pokemon apart, and it is usually the move to use when cleaning up the opponent's team. Confusion caused by Chatter is used to cause switches. While it does not take advantage of Chatot's stronger Special Attack stat, U-turn provides momentum and should be used to wear down Chatot's checks and counters throughout the match by switching into the appropriate response. Hidden Power Ground nails Steelix and Probopass, two notable Pokemon that resist Chatot's main STAB moves. An alternative is Hidden Power Grass, as it allows Chatot to hit Pokemon that are 4x weak to it such as Seismitoad, Rhydon, and Golem for massive damage.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>This set's EV spread maximizes Chatot's Special Attack and Speed. The item choice is entirely up to the player's team, with Choice Specs allowing Chatot to function more as a wallbreaker and Choice Scarf giving it the role of a revenge killer.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>It's important to use U-turn whenever necessary to wear down counters and checks to Chatot. As a result, having a teammate such as Kabutops to aid in the removal of Stealth Rock is a must. Use Chatter to take advantage of switches and clean up the remains of the opponent's team with Boomburst. Faster Pokemon can take advantage of the Choice Specs set's not-so-stellar Speed, and bulky Pokemon can take advantage of the Choice Scarf set's lack of power.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Chatot greatly appreciates a Pursuit trapper such as Liepard or Sneasel that can get rid of Ghost-types, since they are immune to Boomburst. Physical powerhouses such as Rhydon or Archeops that take care of specially defensive Pokemon like Dragalge are also appreciated. Entry hazards are once again essential in order to take advantage of Chatot's ability to force switches. Hazards setters that can cover Chatot's weaknesses and take care of potential checks and counters are appreciated. For example, Qwilfish and Seismitoad can take on the Rock-types that resist Chatot's moves. Probopass can also take on Rock-types, with the added benefit of trapping and eliminating Steel-types such as Ferroseed.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Chatot has a few other options it can use, but they are mostly outclassed by moves already mentioned. Using Heat Wave as a coverage move to hit Steel-types means forgoing Boomburst and having to resort to the much weaker Hyper Voice. Defog gets rid of entry hazards and dual screens. Taunt, coupled with Chatot's good Speed, allows it to prevent foes from using utility moves and setting up hazards, although Chatot isn't a particularly effective Taunt user. Finally, Tailwind gives Chatot and its teammates a temporary Speed boost.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Soundproof</strong>: Pokemon with Soundproof, such as Mr. Mime and Bouffalant, can block both of Chatot's STAB moves.</p>

<p><strong>Powerful Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Archeops acts as a faster check that can OHKO Chatot easily. Rhydon stomachs its main moves and can use Rock Blast in order to destroy Chatot even behind a Substitute. Steel-types such as Steelix and Probopass counter Chatot easily.</p>

<p><strong>Rotom</strong>: Rotom shares the same Speed stat as Chatot, is immune to its main move and resists the other, and may simply eliminate Chatot with a swift STAB Electric-type attack. Its alternate formes, Rotom-F and Rotom-S, can outspeed and KO Chatot if they are using Choice Scarf.</p>

<p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pyroar can easily outspeed Chatot, bypass Substitute, and soundly eliminate it with Hyper Voice. Priority users such as Kangaskhan, Piloswine, and Feraligatr can pick off a weakened Chatot.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Swanna has the niche of being the only viable offensive Defog user in NU. It outspeeds most entry hazard setters in NU and can hit most of them super effectively with its STAB moves, which have good neutral coverage too. However, Swanna's offensive stats are not very high, and it does not hit neutral targets very hard. Swanna is also very frail and thus can't be relied upon for Defog support throughout the match. It is also weak to Stealth Rock, further lowering its switch-in opportunities.</p>

<h1>Defog</h1>

<div class=set>
    Swanna @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Hydration<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Scald<br>- Hurricane<br>- Defog<br>- Roost
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Scald is Swanna's most reliable STAB move and has a 30% chance of burning the target, making physical attackers reluctant to switch into it. Scald also always 2HKOes standard Pawniard, preventing it from easily taking advantage of Swanna's Defog. Hurricane serves as the secondary STAB move, and although it has poor accuracy, it hits hard. Defog is the main reason to use Swanna, which can provide support for offensive teams while still maintaining some offensive presence. Roost provides recovery, offsets Life Orb damage, and allows Swanna to use Defog multiple times.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Swanna to outspeed the crowded base 90 and base 95 Speed tiers. 252 Special Attack EVs allow it to hit as hard as possible. Life Orb is the item of choice as Swanna wants all the power it can get. All of Swanna's abilities are almost useless, but Hydration can help it against rain teams.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Swanna fits on offensive teams which need an entry hazard remover that can also pose as somewhat of an offensive threat. Use Swanna carefully until you need it to clear hazards. Bring Swanna in on weak attacks or Pokemon that it forces out. Once in safely, spam Scald or use Defog if you need to. Use Hurricane cautiously, as an untimely miss can cost you the game. If the opponent has Pawniard, be careful when using Defog, and spam Scald instead. Use Roost on predicted switches if Swanna is low on health, although the opponent can take advantage of it and bring in a threat for free. Don't let Swanna take unnecessary damage, as it is very frail, and the combination of Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage will quickly wear it down.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock greatly appreciate the Defog support provided by Swanna. Magmortar, Archeops, Typhlosion, Jynx, and Vivilion are good examples of such Pokemon that are held back by Stealth Rock and are very dangerous if Stealth Rock is not on their side of the field. Shell Smash Carracosta is also a very good teammate, as it can set up and sweep late-game when its checks and counters have been eliminated, provided Sturdy is not broken, which Swanna can guarantee with Defog. Similarly, other Focus Sash users are good teammates. Gurdurr is a good teammate for Swanna, as it can switch into Rock-type attacks and also check Pawniard. Due to Swanna's 4x weakness to Electric-type moves, Pokemon such as Rhydon, Raichu, and Rotom, which can switch into Electric-type attacks, are also good teammates for Swanna.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Swanna does not have many other options due to its shallow movepool. It can run a rain sweeper set with a 100% accurate Hurricane. Tailwind can be used to give Swanna and its teammates a temporary Speed boost, but it is quite unreliable. Air Slash can be used instead of Hurricane for its greater accuracy, but it is very weak.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Lickilicky and Audino can take all of Swanna's attacks and cripple it with Body Slam or Thunder Wave.</p>

<p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon such as Rotom, Raichu, and Electabuzz can switch into Hurricane and KO back with their STAB attack of choice. Lanturn in particular resists both of Swanna's STAB moves and can OHKO it.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Threats and Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Cyogonal, Tauros, and Archeops can easily revenge kill Swanna. Archeops can also set up Stealth Rock.</p>

<p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Although Swanna can remove it, Stealth Rock still takes away a quarter of its health every time it switches in, and Swanna is forced to use Defog afterwards. This can be taken advantage of by opponents which might switch in a check on the Defog, pressuring Swanna and discouraging it from using Defog.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Purugly has high Speed, allowing it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame; however, it lacks the power to hit hard. This is made better by its ability, Defiant, which allows Purugly to get an Attack boost if it is switched into a Defog or Sticky Web. This is a great asset for teams that rely on stacking entry hazards, as Defiant discourages the use of Defog. Purugly faces competition as a Defiant user from Pawniard, which is bulkier and has a better movepool, but Purugly has merits such as a higher Speed and access to U-turn. It also faces competition as a Normal-type, as Pokemon such as Zangoose and Kangaskhan are stronger, bulkier, and have a wider movepool. Purugly also has low bulk, so a misprediction could be fatal. Its small movepool also makes it easily walled by Rock- and Steel-types such as Regirock and Probopass.</p>

<h1>Physical Attacker</h1>

<div class=set>
    Purugly @ Silk Scarf / Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Defiant<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Fake Out<br>- Return<br>- U-turn<br>- Sucker Punch / Knock Off
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Fake Out allows Purugly to revenge kill or get damage on faster threats and boosted Pokemon. Return is Purugly's main STAB move and strongest attack. U-turn allows Purugly to gain momentum on predicted switches into its counters. Sucker Punch provides stronger priority and hits Ghost-types. Knock Off can be used instead, as it is stronger, more reliable, and can cripple switch-ins due to its secondary effect and Purugly already outspeeds every unboosted Ghost-type. However, Knock Off lacks priority, making Purugly easier to revenge kill.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Purugly to outspeed as much as possible. 252 Attack EVs increase power and can be backed up by either a Silk Scarf, which boosts the power of Normal-type moves, or a Life Orb, which provides a stronger boost to all attacks but can wear Purugly down. Defiant is the chosen ability, as it allows Purugly to switch into Defog and Sticky Web and get a +2 Attack boost, while discouraging Defog as a whole.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Due to its poor bulk, Purugly dislikes switching in on possible hits, so it prefers to switch in after a KO in order to revenge kill. However, Purugly could also be switched in on a predicted Defog to get a +2 Attack boost and then dish out heavy damage. Fake Out shouldn't always be used first turn; on a predicted switch, Purugly should either U-turn to gain momentum or use another, stronger attack. Fake Out followed by Sucker Punch can be used to revenge kill Pokemon that are weakened, faster, or have their stats boosted. Purugly shouldn't be pressured to stay in if it has a boost; using U-turn or hard switching is fine if Purugly is against a Pokemon that walls or outspeeds it.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Purugly should be used with entry hazards, as they bait Defog and Purugly appreciates the chip damage. Entry hazard setters such as Crustle and Accelgor work well, as Purugly prefers to be used on a hyper offensive team with suicide leads. Partners that use Volt Switch and U-turn can bring Purugly in safely while creating a VoltTurn core. Of these, Mespirit can beat Fighting-types, and Primeape can beat Rock- and Steel-types, which otherwise wall Purugly. Because of this, it also appreciates Ground- and Fighting-types such as Golurk and Sawk, respectively. Wallbreakers such as Magmortar can wear down the opponent's walls to a point where Purugly can KO them.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Purugly has limited coverage, its only options being Play Rough, which hits Fighting-types harder, Iron Tail, which 2HKOs Granbull after Intimidate, and Wake-Up Slap, which hits Rock- and Steel-types, though many of them don't take much damage from it. Support-wise, Purugly can use Taunt, which prevents status and recovery, Hypnosis, though it has low accuracy, and Super Fang, which is Purugly's best way of wearing down walls. Quick Attack can be used as more reliable priority, but it is weaker than Sucker Punch, and Facade allows Purugly to take advantage of status, but is otherwise much weaker than Return. Lastly, a Choice Band set can be used for more strength, but Purugly prefers the ability to change moves.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Rock- and Steel-Types</strong>: Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix completely wall Purugly and can use it as entry hazard fodder or deal a lot of damage with their STAB moves. Other Pokemon such as Klinklang and Barbaracle can use it as setup fodder.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Purugly struggles to get past common physical walls such as Vileplume or Seismitoad, which can retaliate or status Purugly.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Poliwrath and Hariyama can take a hit and deal a large amount of damage with their STAB moves. Gurdurr can recover its lost health with Drain Punch or set up Bulk Ups.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority</strong>: Due to Purugly's lack of bulk, Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Typhlosion, and naturally faster Pokemon, like Sceptile, can easily revenge kill it. Priority, such as Feraligatr's Aqua Jet and Kangaskhan's Fake Out, also does a lot of damage.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis makes Purugly easily revenge killed. Ferroseed and Liepard, common Thunder Wave users, can survive a hit and outprioritize due to Prankster. Pokemon such as Vivillon can put Purugly to sleep, shutting it down, while Pokemon such as Rotom-F can burn it, preventing it from doing much damage.</p>

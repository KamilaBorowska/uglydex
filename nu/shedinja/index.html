<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Shedinja has an amazing ability in Wonder Guard that leaves it immune to anything it isn't weak to, giving it loads of switch-in opportunities against some very threatening Pokemon such as Feraligatr, Kangaskhan, Klinklang, and Ludicolo. It also has a decent Attack stat backed by STAB priority in Shadow Sneak to somewhat make up for its lack of Speed. Thanks to Wonder Guard, Shedinja forces a lot of switches because many foes don't carry coverage moves to hit it with, rendering them helpless. Unfortunately, not only does Shedinja have a number of common weaknesses and a pathetic 1 HP that can't even be invested in, but it is also weak to all entry hazards, meaning that it cannot even switch in if they're on the field. Therefore, in order for Shedinja to be effective, it needs support in the form of Pokemon that resist its weaknesses, status absorbers, and hazard control in some from, whether that be Magic Bounce, Rapid Spin, Defog, or any combination of the three.</p>

<h1>Pivot</h1>

<div class=set>
    Shedinja @ Focus Sash<br>
    Ability: Wonder Guard<br>
    EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Baton Pass<br>- Will-O-Wisp<br>- X-Scissor<br>- Shadow Sneak
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Baton Pass is used as a pivoting move, letting Shedinja grab a lot of momentum when used against something that doesn't carry coverage moves to hit Shedinja with. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers on the switch and to soften their attacks for the rest of the team. X-Scissor is the reliable Bug-type STAB move of choice, as it hits decently hard when Shedinja can spare turns attacking. Shedinja can use Shadow Sneak to revenge kill some weaker foes. Alternatively, Protect allows further scouting for moves that might hit Shedinja, increasing its longevity.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>As Shedinja's defenses aren't possible to increase, all of the EVs are put into Attack and Speed. Focus Sash allows Shedinja to take a second hit if needed, while Lum Berry lets Shedinja be a one-time status absorber.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>It's important to play conservatively against Pokemon such as Sceptile or Vileplume that might have a move that hits Shedinja. If possible, scout which coverage moves the foe is running. However, both Sceptile and Vileplume don't like switching in on Shedinja, which can be used to your advantage. While Baton Pass should mainly be used to grab momentum, it's a good idea to use Will-O-Wisp on a predicted switch if the foe could be hindered by a burn. Always look out for Pokemon such as Sandslash and Seismitoad that might carry Toxic or Knock Off as a filler move. Strive to keep Shedinja's Focus Sash intact for as long as possible, but if it can grab an important KO or burn a dangerous threat, it can be worth it to waste its Focus Sash to do so. Using X-Scissor instead of Baton Pass on a predicted switch is a decent option if Shedinja can OHKO or 2HKO the switch-in with a combination of it and Shadow Sneak. However, misjudging this means that your team will have to take more damage, so it's not always the best option.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Thanks to its ability, Magic Bounce, Xatu makes for a perfect partner, as it easily keeps entry hazards off the field and can switch into status with ease. Entry hazards can also be kept off the field with Rapid Spin or Defog support from Pokemon such as Sandslash, Cryogonal, Pelipper, and Swanna. Other good partners are Rock- and Ground-types, such as Rhydon and Golem, as their typing gives them many resistances to the attacks Shedinja fears, and they can also set up Stealth Rock. In return, Shedinja can take the Grass- and Water-type moves aimed at them. Water-types also pair up nicely with Shedinja, as they resist Fire-type moves for it while Shedinja can cover both of their weaknesses. Seismitoad and Prinplup can also set up Stealth Rock for the team, while Pelipper can remove the entry hazards which Shedinja can't live with. Dark-types, such as Liepard and Pawniard, also make for decent partners, as they can Pursuit trap and deal with Ghost-types, as well as take some Dark-type moves aimed at Shedinja. Status absorbers such as Gurdurr are also helpful to take Toxic or Will-O-Wisp for Shedinja.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Sucker Punch can be used over Shadow Sneak to hit a little bit harder, but it is far less reliable and doesn't have that much extra power. A Swords Dance set without Baton Pass is usable, but as Shedinja can't boost its Speed, it's often not recommended. Air Balloon can be used over Focus Sash because it makes Shedinja immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and puts less pressure on your hazard control, but it is not as reliable and the extra hit Shedinja can take thanks to Focus Sash is much more useful in most cases.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Shedinja is hit by all entry hazards and can't switch into any of them other than Sticky Web; setting them up is a very easy way to prevent Shedinja from doing anything at all. In particular, Rhydon is one entry hazard setter that also carries Rock Blast, which bypasses Shedinja's Focus Sash.</p>

<p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Due to Shedinja's unique HP stat, Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are both effective ways to take it out if it doesn't carry a Lum Berry.</p>

<p><strong>Ferroseed</strong>: Ferroseed can switch in and set up Spikes without fearing anything but a burn while also threatening Shedinja with Iron Barbs and Leech Seed. Ferroseed can also set up Stealth Rock or Spikes to stop Shedinja from switching in.</p>

<p><strong>Pyroar</strong>: With an immunity to Will-O-Wisp and Shadow Sneak and a resistance to X-Scissor, Pyroar is able to switch in on Shedinja with very little fear and proceed to use a super effective STAB Fire-type move, either KOing Shedinja or hitting a teammate for substantial damage. However, Pyroar will take quite a bit of damage switching in if both Stealth Rock and Spikes are up.</p>

<p><strong>Coverage Moves</strong>: Anything with a super effective move such as Knock Off, Hidden Power Rock, and Hidden Power Fire is a decent check to Shedinja. Pokemon that Shedinja could otherwise deal with, such as Hariyama, Lilligant, and Audino, have a way past it with their coverage moves.</p>

<p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Sandstorm, hail, and Leech Seed all deal damage to Shedinja and prevent it from even being able to switch in. Pokemon that carry Rocky Helmet such as Garbodor, Granbull, and Xatu all stop Shedinja from attacking, however, Shedinja can still spread burns.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Thanks to its large movepool, Musharna is able to provide valuable team support, reliably heal itself with Moonlight, and perform other roles such as passing Calm Mind boosts to teammates with Baton Pass. Musharna is also bulky and slow enough to act as a pivot. However, its low Speed is detrimental, as it can be easily outsped, revenge killed, or shut down. It is also weak to Knock Off, which is very common. Musharna also faces competition from other Psychic-types, such as Mesprit and Uxie.</p>

<h1>Calm Mind</h1>

<div class=set>
    Musharna @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Synchronize<br>
    EVs: 240 HP / 252 Def / 16 SpD<br>
    Bold Nature<br>
    - Calm Mind<br>- Psychic / Psyshock<br>- Baton Pass / Heal Bell<br>- Moonlight
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Calm Mind allows Musharna to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense. Psychic is a strong STAB move used to hit physical walls, while Psyshock is another strong STAB move used to hit opponents that are bulkier specially, which can be useful for when opponents try to boost up alongside you. Baton Pass allows Musharna to act as a pivot early-game, pass Calm Mind boosts to other teammates, and allow teammates to come in safely, as Musharna is slower than most Pokemon. Heal Bell is used to remove unwanted status and also allows Musharna to win stall wars against Pokemon whose only reliable form of damage is status. Moonlight is used to recover Musharna's HP. Signal Beam can be used over Baton Pass or Heal Bell in order to hit Psychic- and Dark-types.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>240 HP EVs allow Musharna to hit a Leftovers number, while 252 EVs in Defense and a Bold nature allow Musharna to take as many physical hits as possible. Synchronize allows Musharna to cripple opposing status setters and Leftovers is used for passive recovery.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>If Musharna is not using Baton Pass, it should set up only after its checks and counters are weakened or removed. If running Baton Pass, then Musharna can function as a pivot early-game by coming in, taking a hit, and then using Baton Pass on the switch to go into an appropriate check or counter. Moonlight should be used when Musharna is around 60% health, because if its health drops any lower, Musharna can quickly be overpowered and KOed.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that like having a partner that resists Fighting-type moves, such as Pyroar, Kangaskhan, and Klinklang, make for good teammates. Special walls such as Audino, Lickilicky, and Probopass appreciate having Musharna as a switch-in to physical attackers. Special attackers such as Xatu, Magmortar, and Pokemon that cannot use their own boosting moves appreciate Calm Mind boosts from Musharna. Bulky Fighting-type Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Hariyama, and Pangoro make for good teammates as they can absorb Dark-type attacks.</p>

<h1>Offensive Trick Room</h1>

<div class=set>
    Musharna @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Synchronize<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA<br>
    Quiet Nature<br>
    - Trick Room<br>- Psychic<br>- Moonlight<br>- Signal Beam
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Trick Room allows slow Pokemon, such as Musharna, to move first. Psychic is a strong STAB move, Moonlight is used for recovery, and Signal Beam is used to hit Dark- and Psychic-type Pokemon. Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Probopass and other Steel-types, while Hidden Power Fire can be used specifically for Ferroseed.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum HP and Special Attack EVs allow Musharna to hit hard while still being bulky. A Quiet nature is used to lower Musharna's Speed, which means Musharna is even slower and can outspeed more threats under Trick Room, and to also boost its Special Attack. Synchronize allows Musharna to cripple opposing status users, and Leftovers is used for passive recovery.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Musharna should not try to sweep until its checks and counters are weakened. Set up Trick Room first and then either stay in and attempt a sweep, or switch out into another Trick Room sweeper.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Good teammates include other Trick Room setters such as Uxie, Carbink, and Gourgeist-XL, and other Trick Room sweepers such as Pangoro, Beheeyem, and Ursaring. Entry hazard setters such as Crustle and Ferroseed can help limit switching, and bulky Fighting-type Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Hariyama and Pangoro can absorb Dark-type attacks and also benefit from Trick Room support.</p>

<h1>Pivot</h1>

<div class=set>
    Musharna @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Synchronize<br>
    EVs: 240 HP / 252 Def / 16 SpD<br>
    Bold Nature<br>
    - Baton Pass<br>- Moonlight<br>- Thunder Wave / Yawn / Heal Bell<br>- Psychic
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Baton Pass allows Musharna to slowly pivot out and safely bring in an appropriate check or counter, and Moonlight allows Musharna to regain some health. Thunder Wave cripples fast offensive Pokemon, while Yawn is used to put a Pokemon to sleep and to force switches. Heal Bell allows Musharna to cure itself and its teammates of status. Lastly, Psychic is a spammable STAB move.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>240 EVs in HP allow Musharna to hit a Leftovers number, 16 Special Defense EVs are used to make it a little bit bulkier, and the remaining EVs in Defense with a Bold nature allow Musharna to take as many physical hits as possible. Leftovers is used for passive recovery.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Bring in Musharna on physical attacks and then use Baton Pass on the switch. When Musharna's health gets to around 60%, use Moonlight to keep its health close to full. Use Thunder Wave or Yawn on the switch to cripple opposing Pokemon. Yawn can also be used to force a Pokemon trying to set up out. Use Baton Pass after you use Yawn to gain momentum.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that like having a Fighting-resistant Pokemon as a partner make for good teammates, such as Pyroar, Kangaskhan, and Klinklang. Special walls such as Audino, Lickilicky, and Probopass appreciate having Musharna as a switch-in to physical attackers. Other good teammates are entry hazard setters such as Crustle, Accelgor, and Ferroseed, as they limit switching, and bulky Fighting-type Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Hariyama, and Pangoro, as they can absorb Dark-type attacks.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Dazzling Gleam is a good other option that notably hits Pangoro; however, Signal Beam hits more targets and allows Musharna to check or counter other Psychic-type Pokemon. Barrier is another option that boosts Musharna's Defense a lot. Energy Ball can be used as coverage move to hit Ground- and Water-types, and Healing Wish can be used when Musharna going to be KOed to fully heal a teammate. Protect can be used to scout Choice-locked Pokemon, Magic Coat can throw back status and hazards, and Stored Power can be used on a boosting set; however, it requires Musharna to set up Calm Mind before it can attack effectively. Toxic can cripple opposing walls and limit the amount of turns they can stay in, and Choice Specs allows Musharna to hit hard.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Liepard and Pawniard can overwhelm Musharna with their Dark-type attacks, or depending on Musharna's set, set up on it.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Musharna from accomplishing the majority of its roles, thereby nullifying it.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: If Musharna is not running Heal Bell, status can quickly wear it down. However, the opposing status user has to be wary of Synchronize.</p>

<p><strong>Trick</strong>: Pokemon that use Trick such as Mesprit, Rotom, and Jynx, can limit Musharna's utility by only allowing it to use one move.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Steelix, Probopass, and Ferroseed resist Musharna's STAB moves and can also hit it with a Toxic and not get poisoned in return by Synchronize.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Multiple layers of Spikes in combination with Stealth Rock limit the amount of times that Musharna can comfortably switch in to take attacks. It also forces Musharna to use Moonlight more often instead of pivoting.</p>

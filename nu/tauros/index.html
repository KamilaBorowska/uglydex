<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Thanks to its amazing Speed and Sheer Force, Tauros has a niche over other Normal-type attackers such as Kangaskhan and Zangoose. It boasts a high Attack stat, and has access to a free Life Orb boost thanks to Sheer Force, which grants Tauros more staying power than Pokemon that suffer from Toxic Orb such as Zangoose and Ursaring. It also has access to a decent movepool, which makes it capable of taking out Fighting-types, its only weakness. However, the main downside to using Tauros is that the Sheer Force set has an unreliable main attack due shaky accuracy, and the Choice Scarf set has limited cleaning potential as its main attacks have no super effective coverage.</p>

<h1>Life Orb Attacker</h1>

<div class=set>
    Tauros @ Life Orb<br>
    Ability: Sheer Force<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Naive Nature<br>
    - Rock Climb<br>- Earthquake<br>- Zen Headbutt / Rock Slide<br>- Fire Blast
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Rock Climb is a very solid and powerful STAB attack, boosted by Sheer Force. Earthquake gives coverage for taking out Rock- and Steel-types, which resist Tauros's STAB attack. Zen Headbutt offers a great amount of damage on Fighting-types in NU, and hits Pokemon such as Haunter and Weezing hard. Rock Slide grants coverage alongside Earthquake and hits a wider variety of opponents, which improves Tauros's revenge killing power. Despite its poor Special Attack stat, Fire Blast is useful to hit physically defensive Pokemon like Ferroseed, Steelix, and Avalugg, as it can't beat them with other moves. Thanks to its Speed, Tauros is capable of cleaning up.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximized Speed investment makes Tauros capable of launching powerful hits as quickly as possible, and maximized Attack ensures that it will hit its hardest. The Naive nature boosts Tauros's Speed while making sure that its Fire Blast is not weakened. A Life Orb is the best item for this set because it provides a valuable power boost for Tauros's moves, and Sheer Force negates Life Orb recoil on all Tauros's attacks but Earthquake.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Bring in Tauros to revenge kill a foe, or into a slow Pokemon to force a switch. Refrain from using Rock Climb if another more accurate move can get the KO.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Tauros is severely crippled by burns. Teammates with Magic Bounce or cleric support will be able to fend off the status that Tauros loathes. Bulky Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves and can quickly get rid of Fighting-type foes, such as Granbull, are great teammates for Tauros as well.</p>

<h1>Choice Scarf</h1>

<div class=set>
    Tauros @ Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Intimidate<br>
    EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br>
    Jolly Nature<br>
    - Retaliate<br>- Double-Edge<br>- Earthquake<br>- Stone Edge
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Retaliate is a great STAB move for a designated revenge killing set such as this, thanks to to the power boost it receives when an ally has fainted. Double-Edge is a very powerful STAB attack option that is capable of inflicting a ton of damage on a lot of opponents. Earthquake is a necessity for hitting Steel- and Rock-types, which resist the rest of its moveset. Stone Edge offers coverage against Flying- and Ice-types. </p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Full investment in Speed and Attack makes Tauros capable of launching powerful hits quickly. Furthermore, a Jolly nature boosts Tauros's Speed, allowing it to outspeed targets that cannot be outsped with an Adamant nature, such as Choice Scarf Typhlosion. The Choice Scarf in combination with Tauros's amazing Speed allows it to outspeed any unboosted opponent.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Use Tauros as a powerful lead, or as a revenge killer when one of its allies has just been taken down. Also, be cautious when your opponent has a Ghost-type around; Ghost-types can come in on a Choice-locked STAB attack and force Tauros out.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Slow Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Probopass, Uxie, and Scyther work well as teammates; they grant Tauros a safe switch-in so that Tauros can start attacking at full health, although Tauros has enough bulk to take a hit that is not super effective. A special Pokemon that resists Fighting-type moves, and has an advantage over Fighting-types, such as Mesprit or Exeggutor, is an excellent partner for Tauros as well.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Pursuit can be used to trap Ghost-types. Iron Tail is unreliable and rather niche, but hits Rock-types harder than Earthquake and OHKOes Slurpuff after Stealth Rock. Iron Head is also an option because it has more accuracy than Iron Tail, but has less Base Power. Wild Charge can be used for its coverage against Flying- and Water-types, but its recoil is unfavorable and other coverage options are preferable.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Gourgeist, Spiritomb, and Weezing can easily switch in on Taruos's physical attacks and burn it.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Tauros also absolutely hates Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave; Tauros is effectively neutered by having either its Attack or Speed cut.</p>

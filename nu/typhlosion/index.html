<h1>Tiers</h1>
<ul class=nav>
<li><a href='/uglydex/nu/typhlosion'>NU</a>
</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Typhlosion's solid Special Attack and Speed stats make it a good special attacker in the NU metagame. It also has good bulk for an offensive Pokemon, even though it relies on not losing any HP for Eruption to be at maximum power. It faces heavy competition from Pyroar, but Blaze and Eruption set it apart. Also unlike Pyroar, Typhlosion is not weak to Mach Punch. Its movepool is varied, containing options such as Fire Blast, Eruption, Focus Blast, and Extrasensory, although it often relies on Hidden Power Grass to deal any significant damage to the Water-types in the tier. Sadly, its weakness to Stealth Rock and and the abundance of priority moves on Pokemon such as Feraligatr and Kangaskhan can mean Typhlosion isn't safe to spam Eruption as much as it would want to.</p>

<h1>Choice Specs</h1>

<div class=set>
    Typhlosion @ Choice Specs<br>
    Ability: Blaze<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Eruption<br>- Fire Blast<br>- Hidden Power Grass<br>- Extrasensory / Focus Blast
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Eruption hits ridiculously hard with Choice Specs and allows Typhlosion to break down special walls. Fire Blast also hits hard if Typhlosion's HP gets lower than 73% or 229 HP, at which point Fire Blast has more Base Power than Eruption. Hidden Power Grass is used to hit Water-types, especially Seismitoad, as well as Rhydon. Extrasensory allows Typhlosion to hit Dragalge and Thick Fat Hariyama super effectively, while Focus Blast hits opposing Rock-types such as Probopass and Regirock, as well as Audino and Lickilicky harder than Eruption if it isn't at maximum power.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Choice Specs in conjunction with Typhlosion's high Special Attack and Eruption allows it to act as a strong wallbreaker. The EV spread is straightforward for any attacker, with maximum Special Attack and Speed and a Timid nature to outspeed Pokemon such as Jynx, Vivillon, and Electivire. A Modest nature can be used if Typhlosion is on a Sticky Web team, as Typhlosion will hit considerably harder than it does with a Timid nature, but it will be slower than the aforementioned threats.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Choice Specs Typhlosion is a wallbreaker, and it should be used accordingly. Use it early- and mid-game to tear down walls with a full-power Eruption, and preferably when there aren't any entry hazards on the field that can take away from Typhlosion's HP and therefore reduce Eruption's power. If Typhlosion gets below 73% HP, then Fire Blast will have more Base Power and should be used. This means that even if Typhlosion switches into Stealth Rock once, Eruption will still be slightly more powerful than Fire Blast. Even though Stealth Rock removes 24% of Typhlosion's health each time it switches in, it can be exploited to put Typhlosion in Blaze activation range.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Because Typhlosion depends a lot on Eruption to wallbreak, entry hazard removal is important. Therefore, spinners such as Sandslash and Cryogonal and Defoggers such as Swanna and Pelipper are good teammates. Teammates that lay down entry hazards are also good teammates as they can help Typhlosion wallbreak more easily. Seismitoad, Sandslash, and Rhydon are good for setting up Stealth Rock, while Qwilfish and Accelgor are good Spikes setters. Omastar and Crustle get a special mention, as they have access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Grass-types such as Sceptile, Lilligant, and offensive Vileplume are good for removing Water-types such as Feraligatr and Lanturn that Typhlosion struggles to beat. Along with the other Grass-types, Exeggutor and Victreebel stand out as Chlorophyll sweepers under Sunny Day, which Typhlosion can benefit from as well. Uxie is a good Pokemon for setting up Sunny Day and Stealth Rock, while Liepard can utilize Prankster Sunny Day, Encore, and U-turn to do the same. Sweepers such as Feraligatr, Slurpuff, and Vivillon that can come in after Typhlosion has broken walls are good teammates. Other Fire-types such as mixed Magmortar and Choice Specs Pyroar can work well with Typhlosion to pressure the opponent's Fire-type checks and counters and wear them down to a point where they're easily taken out.</p>

<h1>Choice Scarf</h1>

<div class=set>
    Typhlosion @ Choice Scarf<br>
    Ability: Blaze<br>
    EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Timid Nature<br>
    - Eruption<br>- Fire Blast / Flamethrower<br>- Focus Blast<br>- Hidden Power Grass
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Eruption is a strong move when at maximum HP. Fire Blast is another strong STAB move that can be used at 73% HP or lower, when Eruption's Base Power becomes lower than that of Fire Blast. Flamethrower is an option instead of Fire Blast for more consistency thanks to its accuracy, but it doesn't outdamage Eruption unless Typhlosion is at 59% HP or less. Focus Blast is used to hit Rock-types such as Probopass and Regirock, as well as Audino and Lickilicky, and Hidden Power Grass is for Rhydon and Water-types such as Seismitoad.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>A straightforward EV spread is used, with maximum investment in both Special Attack and Speed. A Timid nature along with Choice Scarf allows Typhlosion to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame while still being faster than other Choice Scarf users such as Primeape, Electivire, and Jynx.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Choice Scarf Typhlosion is a revenge killer and late-game cleaner, and it should be used accordingly. Use it mid- and late-game to revenge kill whenever needed, and preferably when there aren't any entry hazards on the field that can take away from Typhlosion's HP and therefore reduce Eruption's power. If Typhlosion gets below 73% HP, or 59% for if using Flamethrower, then Typhlosion's other Fire-type move will have more Base Power than Eruption and should be used. This means that even if Typhlosion switches into Stealth Rock once, Eruption will still be slightly more powerful than Fire Blast. Even though Stealth Rock removes 24% of Typhlosion's health each time it switches in, it can be exploited to put Typhlosion in Blaze activation range, and Fire Blast's power will get a much-needed a boost.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Entry hazard removal is important for Typhlosion to work, so Rapid Spin users such as Sandslash and Cryogonal and Defoggers such as Swanna and Pelipper are good teammates. Because Typhlosion is used as a cleaner or a late-game sweeper, hazards are good to wear down opponents. For that reason, Seismitoad, Sandslash, and Rhydon are good teammates for their ability to lay down Stealth Rock, while Qwilfish and Accelgor are good Spikes setters. Omastar and Crustle can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Grass-types such as Sceptile, Lilligant, and offensive Vileplume to remove Water-types such as Feraligatr and Lanturn are appreciated. Typhlosion fits well on Sunny Day teams, so Chlorophyll sweepers such as Exeggutor and Victreebel are good teammates, as well as Sunny Day setters such as Uxie, which can set up Stealth Rock and has access to Memento to bring in a sweeper safely, and Liepard, which has priority Sunny Day, Encore, and U-turn. Wallbreakers such as Tauros, Choice Band Sawk, and Swords Dance Feraligatr are good partners, as they can weaken the opponent's team, allowing Typhlosion to sweep. Other Fire-types such as mixed Magmortar and Choice Specs Pyroar can work well with Typhlosion to pressure the opponent's Fire-type checks and counters and wear them down to a point at which they're easily taken out.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Typhlosion doesn't have many options that aren't outclassed by other Pokemon or its other sets. It can utilize a Sunny Day set with Heat Rock, but Typhlosion appreciates Choice Specs or Choice Scarf more, and it's better if another Pokemon sets up Sunny Day for it. A mixed set with Expert Belt, Earthquake, Thunder Punch, and Eruption or Fire Blast can be used, but Magmortar does a better job at that. Will-O-Wisp is an option to spread status, but Typhlosion should be attacking rather than burning opponents. Finally, a Substitute + Salac or Petaya Berry set can be used to bring Typhlosion down to Blaze range, but it is easily revenge killed with priority, and Typhlosion is better off attacking from the first turn with Eruption.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: The best way to keep Typhlosion in check is to lay down entry hazards and keep them up. Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, and Spikes all wear down Typhlosion incredibly quickly and weaken its Eruption.</p>

<p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Lanturn can switch in rather easily thanks to its HP and Special Defense and either gain momentum with Volt Switch or heavily damage Typhlosion with Scald. Even though Feraligatr can set up on Typhlosion locked into a Fire-type move, it still takes a hefty amount from a full-powered Eruption coming off of Choice Specs Typhlosion.</p>

<p><strong>Special Tanks and Walls</strong>: Hariyama can stomach most Fire-type attacks with ease thanks to Thick Fat, and can either hurt Typhlosion with Earthquake or Close Combat or cripple it with Knock Off, removing its Choice item. Flash Fire Pokemon can switch into Typhlosion rather easily. Flareon and Ninetales both have naturally high Special Defense and can switch into anything Typhlosion has. Finally, Audino can switch in and, though it can't take a Choice Specs-boosted Fire Blast or full-power Eruption, can use Protect to drain Eruption's PP and act as a Regenerator pivot.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Pyroar can easily revenge kill Typhlosion. Pokemon such as Swellow and Tauros can outspeed unboosted Typhlosion and hit it hard with their STAB moves.</p>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority moves prevent Typhlosion from spamming Eruption and can finish off Typhlosion quickly. Aqua Jet from Feraligatr, Sucker Punch from Cacturne, and Fake Out + Sucker Punch from Kangaskhan can wear it down quickly.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Magmortar is a very powerful special wallbreaker in NU, with a very high Special Attack stat that allows it to muscle past very bulky Pokemon such as Audino. It has a wide variety of coverage moves, such as Thunderbolt, Focus Blast, Earthquake, and Psychic, to hit its common switch-ins. It also has a great ability in Vital Spirit, giving Magmortar an immunity to sleep-inducing moves from the likes of Vivillon, Vileplume, and Jynx. In addition to this, its decent special bulk and useful resistances allow it to take on a bulkier yet still very powerful route with Assault Vest, capable of taking on powerhouses such as Typhlosion.</p>

<p>However, Magmortar faces a lot of competition as a Fire-type from Typhlosion and Pyroar, both of which are much faster than Magmortar. Magmortar's middling Speed also leaves it outsped by common threats such as Scyther, Liepard, and Archeops. Magmortar is also susceptible to all forms of entry hazards, in particular Stealth Rock.</p>

<h1>Assault Vest</h1>

<div class=set>
    Magmortar @ Assault Vest<br>
    Ability: Vital Spirit<br>
    EVs: 104 HP / 252 SpA / 152 Spe<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Fire Blast<br>- Thunderbolt<br>- Hidden Power Water / Hidden Power Grass<br>- Psychic / Flame Charge
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Fire Blast hits extremely hard with maximum Special Attack investment. Thunderbolt sets Magmortar apart from other Fire-type attackers, and is extremely useful for hitting bulky Water-types such as Mantine, Pelipper, and Prinplup.Hidden Power Water hits Mega Camerupt super effectively, while also hitting Rhydon. Hidden Power Grass is used to hit Rhydon, Lanturn, Quagsire, and Seismitoad super effectively. Psychic hits one of Magmortar's most common switch-ins, Hariyama, for respectable damage; this is extremely helpful because Hariyama typically lacks reliable recovery. If Hariyama isn't a concern, Flame Charge can be used over Psychic to give Magmortar the opportunity to sweep late-game. Flame Charge can also be used over Hidden Power Grass rather than Psychic. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for reliability, although it is considerably weaker and misses the 2HKO on Pokemon such as Musharna, Kecleon, and Audino after Stealth Rock.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The given EV spread allows Magmortar to hit as hard as possible and outrun everything up to and including neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Ludicolo. The remaining 104 EVs are invested in HP to give Magmortar some additional bulk. Magmortar capitalizes on this additional bulk by running Assault Vest, which allows Magmortar to check several powerful special attackers such as Lilligant and Typhlosion. Both Vital Spirit and Flame Body are viable abilities, but Vital Spirit allows Magmortar to check Sleep Powder users such as Vivillon, Vileplume, and Lilligant. Flame Body can be used for its 30% chance to burn foes on contact, giving Magmortar the ability to potentially punish U-turn users. However, losing the ability to check sleep inducers such as Jynx, Lilligant, and Vivillon can be devastating for some teams.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Switch Magmortar into special attacking Grass-, Fire-, and Ice-types such as Lilligant, Typhlosion, and Jynx. Just be wary of Psyshock users such as Ninetales, Jynx, and Mesprit. Thanks to Vital Spirit, Magmortar can switch into sleep-inducing moves such as Sleep Powder and Lovely Kiss from Pokemon such as Lilligant, Vivillon, and Jynx. While Magmortar does enjoy switching in on several common Pokemon, entry hazards can wear it down quickly; for example, a layer of Spikes and Stealth Rock can turn crucial 3HKOs into 2HKOs, such as with Choice Specs Typhlosion's Eruption. So, whenever possible, clear the field of entry hazards before Magmortar switches in.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Water-type Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Lanturn, and Feraligatr appreciate Magmortar's ability to switch into Grass-type attacks with ease. They can also take Water-type attacks aimed at Magmortar. Grass-type Pokemon such as Vileplume, Gourgeist, and Leafeon appreciate Magmortar switching to Fire- and Ice-type attacks, and they can also take most Ground- and Water-type attacks aimed at Magmortar. Fire-type Pokemon such as Typhlosion, Ninetales, and Pyroar have similar checks and counters to Magmortar that they appreciate worn down. Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Claydol, Sandslash, and Mantine can clear the field of entry hazards and give Magmortar an easier time switching into attacks. Finally, entry hazard setters such as Crustle, Steelix, Qwilfish, and Garbodor can help Magmortar secure important KOs on specially defensive Pokemon such as Mega Audino and Rhydon.</p>

<h1>Mixed Attacker</h1>

<div class=set>

    Ability: Vital Spirit<br>
    EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe<br>
    Mild Nature<br>
    - Fire Blast<br>- Thunderbolt<br>- Earthquake<br>- Hidden Power Grass / Focus Blast
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Fire Blast is Magmortar's most powerful special STAB move and deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it. Thunderbolt is used to hit Water- and Flying-types, such as Samurott, Pelipper, and Archeops, for super effective damage. Earthquake provides great coverage against Pokemon that can easily take the first two attacks, such as Lanturn, Flareon, and Probopass. Hidden Power Grass hits Rock- and Ground-types such as Seismitoad and Rhydon, while Focus Blast hits bulky Normal-types, such as Audino and Lickilicky, that can comfortably switch in on Magmortar's other attacks.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed base 80 Pokemon. A Mild nature is chosen to bolster Magmortar's Special Attack while not taking away from Earthquake's damage output and preserve its better defense stat. Life Orb is used to give all of Magmortar's attacks a significant boost in power. An Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice item and not take recoil after each attack. A Hasty nature is an option to outspeed Adamant Sawk, Timid Mesprit, and opposing Magmortar.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Magmortar is used best as a revenge killer against slower opponents, especially those lacking a priority attack. Double switches are beneficial to get Magmortar in safely to fire off an attack. Magmortar excels against slower teams, as it can break through many common defensive Pokemon with the proper coverage moves. Even though Magmortar has decent Special Defense, it is best to not let it take hits, because it already gets worn down quickly between entry hazard damage and Life Orb recoil.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Entry hazard support is very beneficial to Magmortar to wear down its switch-ins, and it helps Magmortar achieve feats such as a very high chance to OHKO Audino after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Garbodor, Qwilfish, and Crustle are all good teammates to set up entry hazards. Rapid Spin support is important to keep Magmortar healthy; Cryogonal, Kabutops, and Sandslash are all great partners for this position. Late-game cleaners that appreciate Magmortar's wallbreaking ability are also good teammates. Feraligatr, Lilligant, Swellow, and Mismagius are all good examples. Due to Magmortar's subpar Speed, Thunder Wave support from the likes of Liepard, Probopass, Uxie, or Qwilfish is appreciated to help Magmortar deal with faster threats.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>A Choice Scarf set can be used to catch some faster Pokemon off guard, but the power loss is significant. A set with Belly Drum and Mach Punch can be used, but it is fairly gimmicky and situational. Substitute can be used to take advantage of the various switches that Magmortar forces, but Magmortar generally needs as many coverage moves as possible.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to its subpar Speed, Magmortar can be stopped by some NU's faster Pokemon, such as Archeops, Sawk, Electivire and Kangaskhan.</p>

<p><strong>Thick Fat Pokemon</strong>: Thick Fat Pokemon such as Hariyama and Grumpig take little damage from Magmortars Fire-type attacks and are not weak to Magmortar's coverage moves. Hariyama can take any move Magmortar goes for and OHKO it with Close Combat after one round of Life Orb Recoil.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Magmortar is quickly worn down by entry hazards alongside Life Orb recoil, in particular Stealth Rock.</p>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: Due to Magmortar's poor Defense, it is susceptible to priority attacks from the likes of Kangaskhan, Feraligatr, Kabutops, Pawniard, and Gurdurr.</p>

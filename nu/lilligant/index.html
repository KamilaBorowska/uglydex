<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Lilligant is a potent sweeper in NU due to its good Special Attack and its access to one of the best boosting moves, Quiver Dance. Additionally, it can utilize Sleep Powder to neutralize its counters. However, Lilligant suffers from a poor offensive typing and movepool, and is forced to use the weak Hidden Power for coverage. It faces stiff competition with the many other Grass-types in the tier for a slot in the team, such as Sceptile, Ferroseed, and Vileplume. Despite these flaws, Lilligant is a huge threat that can easily pull off sweeps with the right support.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Quiver Dance is the most important move on this set as it boosts Lilligant's Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stats. Giga Drain is the preferred STAB move for its reliability and healing, which works well with the added bulk provided by Quiver Dance. The coverage move depends on the types of Pokemon one wants to target with Lilligant. Hidden Power Ice hits the Grass-, Dragon-, and Flying-types which resist Giga Drain. Hidden Power Fire also hits Grass-types, but forgoes coverage on Dragon- and Flying-types to hit Steel- and Bug-types. Hidden Power Rock is also an option to hit Magmortar, but the inability to hurt Grass-types is undesirable as they have an immunity to Sleep Powder. The last moveslot is dedicated to Sleep Powder, which can disable the opponent for a few turns. However, one should remember not to use it on Grass-types or Pokemon with Vital Spirit or Insomnia, as they are immune to it.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>252 EVs in Special Attack and Speed are used to maximize Lilligant's offensive prowess. A Timid nature is needed to outpace threats such as positive natured Sawk and Mesprit before a boost, and to Speed tie with Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Zangoose, if using Hidden Power Ice. Lum Berry allows Lilligant to avoid status from Pokemon such as Lanturn, Regirock, Rotom, and Uxie, all of which are targets that Lilligant might set up on. Life Orb is an option to hit harder, but is less useful than Lum Berry in most scenarios. Own Tempo helps Lilligant to avoid confusion from Golurk's Dynamic Punch and Chatot's Chatter. Chlorophyll can be used to perform better against Sunny Day teams; however Lilligant generally should not be used on such teams.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Due to the low Base Power of Lilligant's attacks, it generally needs to accumulate two Quiver Dances to have a chance at sweeping a healthy team. Likewise, Lilligant also needs two Quiver Dances to outrun common Choice Scarf users such as Typhlosion, Pyroar, and Rotom, although the latter cannot do significant damage back. Sleep Powder can aid one in accomplishing this goal, but should be used with caution because of its unreliable accuracy. In cases where Lilligant cannot sweep immediately, one should try to predict the counter that might switch in and put it to sleep.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Lilligant appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Qwilfish and Crustle, as it helps to wear down bulky Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Vileplume, and Dragalge. Teammates that can take attacks from offensive Fire-types and Bouffalant are helpful, as they will usually force Lilligant out. Other sweepers that can take advantage of Pokemon such as Vileplume and Dragalge being weakened or removed, such as Feraligatr or Gurdurr, make for good partners, as Lilligant can weaken them until they can no longer wall anything else.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Petal Dance seems tempting in conjunction with Own Tempo to avoid the self-induced confusion, but will still lock you in for a few turns and is therefore unviable, as Lilligant would be walled by the many bulky Pokemon that resist Grass-type moves in the tier. A Choice Scarf set with Sleep Powder, Leaf Storm, Hidden Powder coverage, and Healing Wish can provide great utility for a team, but is too easily walled by Lilligant's usual counters to be effective. Yache Berry is viable to take various Ice-type moves such as Feraligatr's Ice Punch and Cryogonal's Ice Beam, but its use is limited only to a few scenarios.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Sap Sipper</strong>: Bouffalant and Miltank with Sap Sipper counter all of Lilligant's sets, as they take negligible damage from Hidden Power.</p>

<p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Muk, Garbodor, and Clear Smog Weezing can take any attack from Lilligant other than Sleep Powder. Dragalge can force Lilligant out with Dragon Tail or KO it with a Choice Specs boosted Sludge Bomb, but does not enjoy taking Hidden Power Ice.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Typhlosion and Pyroar outspeed Lilligant even after Quiver Dance and can revenge kill it with Fire Blast, but must watch out for Sleep Powder when switching in. Magmortar is unaffected by Sleep Powder, but must watch out for a boosted Hidden Power Rock.</p>

<p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Both Xatu and Vullaby are immune to Sleep Powder and take little damage from Giga Drain. However, they have to beware of Hidden Power Rock and Hidden Power Ice.</p>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Vileplume do not enjoy taking a super effective Hidden Power, but completely shut down Lilligant otherwise.</p>

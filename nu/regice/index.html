<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Despite its terrible typing, Regice is a good Pokemon because it has incredible stats. As the bulkiest Ice-type in NU, Regice has a niche as an offensive Ice-type that doubles as a great check to a variety of special attackers. Regice is best used offensively, as it has no reliable recovery and does its job just as well without much defensive investment as it would with heavy investment. Regice's role on a team varies depending on what you need it to do; it can function as a late-game cleaner with Rock Polish or as a wallbreaker with an incredibly powerful Choice Specs set. However, Regice's weaknesses to Stealth Rock and the very common Fighting- and Fire-type attacks limit how often it can switch in throughout the match. It is also very slow, which can leave it struggling to do much against offensive teams.</p>

<h1>Choice Specs</h1>

<div class=set>
    Regice @ Choice Specs<br>

    EVs: 168 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 84 Spe<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Ice Beam<br>- Thunderbolt<br>- Focus Blast<br>- Sleep Talk / Frost Breath
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Ice Beam is Regice's most reliable STAB move. Thunderbolt offers coverage against bulky Water-types and has great neutral coverage alongside Regice's STAB. Focus Blast hits the few Pokemon that can take on Ice and Electric coverage well, namely Lanturn and bulky Steel-types. Sleep Talk enhances Regice's ability to take on offensive Grass-types such as Lilligant and offers offensive teams a Sleep absorber, while Frost Breath gives Regice the ability to take on Calm Mind users such as Uxie, Musharna, and Mega Audino.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The Speed investment allows Regice to outrun uninvested Pokemon with base 60 Speed, including Tangela and Weezing, while maximum Special Attack investment enhances Regice's power. The remaining EVs are put into HP, with the exception of 4 Special Defense EVs to allow Regice to switch into Stealth Rock four times and survive. With Choice Specs, Regice can hit hard without sacrificing its bulk.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Against more offensively oriented teams, Regice is best used as a pivot into the many special attackers that don't carry coverage to hit it, especially Lilligant and Mismagius. From there, you can comfortably use Ice Beam, as most Pokemon that resist Ice on offensive teams still won't take the hit well. Against bulkier teams, try to preserve Regice's HP, as you can switch it in frequently against defensive Pokemon. For the same reason, avoid switching into Stealth Rock unless it becomes necessary.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Regice works exceptionally well with VoltTurn support, as you can pressure the opponent into playing more defensively and get a free switch into Regice to start firing off powerful attacks. Scyther, Liepard, and Primeape are exceptional partners for their ability to force in physically defensive Pokemon for Regice to exploit. Hazard prevention is crucial because Regice will be switching in frequently and is vulnerable to every form of entry hazard. Xatu is the best Pokemon to fulfill this role because it also offers U-turn support and doesn't require a loss of momentum to remove entry hazards. Prinplup, Sandslash, and Pelipper are also fine teammates, as they share defensive synergy with Regice. Setup sweepers that can take advantage of Regice's wallbreaking capabilities are also good partners. Samurott, Lilligant, and Ninetales can all clean weakened teams well.</p>

<h1>Rock Polish</h1>

<div class=set>
    Regice @ Life Orb<br>

    EVs: 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Rock Polish<br>- Ice Beam<br>- Thunderbolt<br>- Focus Blast
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Rock Polish gives Regice the ability to set up late-game and clean weakened teams. Ice Beam is Regice's most reliable STAB move. Thunderbolt offers coverage against bulky Water-types and has great neutral coverage alongside Regice's STAB. Focus Blast hits the few Pokemon that can take on Ice- and Electric-type coverage well, namely Lanturn and bulky Steel-types.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>224 Speed EVs allow +2 Regice to outrun Swellow, while maximum Special Attack investment allows Regice to hit as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are put into HP to give Regice a bit more bulk and a couple more possible hits with Life Orb recoil. An alternate EV spread of 96 HP / 252 SpA / 160 Spe allows +2 Regice to outrun Tauros and Archeops and offers a bit more bulk. A Life Orb is used for the extra power that it provides, which is crucial for Regice to clean, as Rock Polish only boosts its Speed.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Regice should be used to clean the opposing team once its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened. You can also use Regice to pivot into special attackers throughout the battle, but you should avoid doing so if you intend to use Regice as your win condition. Assess the opponent's team during Team Preview in order to decide how you'll be using Regice. If the opponent's team prevents you from getting an opportunity to set up or if they have multiple strong checks to Regice, you probably won't be able to clean with it and should feel more comfortable using it as a pivot instead.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Hazard support can help wear down the opposing team throughout the match and make it easier for Regice to clean late-game. Because you won't be bringing Regice in frequently throughout the match, your hazard setters don't need to share defensive synergy with it, making most Stealth Rock and Spikes users fine partners. Garbodor is one of the most reliable defensive Spikes setters, whereas Crustle is one of the most reliable suicide hazard leads. With its excellent coverage, Regice doesn't need too much support to break down checks and counters. Hariyama and Lanturn are the most reliable answers to Regice, so bulky Grass / Poison types such as Vileplume and Roselia make for good partners that can respond to both. These two can also absorb Toxic Spikes to help Regice stick around longer once it has set up. Hazard removal in general isn't essential, but it is still appreciated because of Regice's Stealth Rock weakness. Prinplup, Xatu, and Sandslash are all reliable at handling hazards.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Regice doesn't have many other options aside from the sets listed due to its shallow movepool. In terms of other sets, an offensive set with Leftovers is about as good as it gets. Such a set can still pivot into special attackers and pose an offensive threat to the opposing team with the added benefits of more sustainability and support options such as Thunder Wave. A bulky RestTalk set is usable, but it is too passive and has the potential to lose offensive momentum while sleeping. It also faces a lot of competition from more reliable defensive pivots with better typing. A Gravity set has potential with powerful attacking moves such as Blizzard and Zap Cannon, but it would require a turn of setup without much of a benefit. Toxic can also be used to wear down bulky defensive Pokemon alongside Protect to rack up poison damage and regain Leftovers recovery.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Lanturn is one of the best answers to Regice because of its resistance to BoltBeam coverage and high special bulk that allows it to tank repeated Focus Blasts. Although it cannot do much in return, Lanturn can still use Volt Switch to gain momentum and bring in a Pokemon that can threaten Regice.</p>

<p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Simply keeping up offensive pressure can prevent Regice from getting a free switch and either firing off powerful attacks or setting up. This can be difficult for some teams that rely on offensive Grass- and Electric-types, but it is still doable for most balanced and offensive teams.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Because Regice has a weakness to Stealth Rock and a vulnerability to every form of entry hazard, simply setting and keeping them up often heavily neuters its potential in a battle.</p>

<p><strong>Hariyama</strong>: Thanks to Thick Fat, Hariyama resists Regice's Ice-type STAB without being hit hard by any of its coverage moves. Hariyama also often carries an Assault Vest, which enhances its special bulk and allows it to switch into Regice repeatedly throughout the match.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Sandslash is one of the best dedicated spinners in the NU tier, as it has great physical bulk, a decent movepool, a great offensive typing, and a high Attack stat, which it can further boost with Swords Dance. Additionally, Sandslash not only has access to Stealth Rock but also resists it and can be used to both set it and remove it. However, Sandslash's weaknesses to common Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks are great hindrances for it. It also has a low Special Defense stat, so it cannot take a decently powered special hit. Finally, Sandslash's Speed is very low. Because of these flaws, almost any fast and powerful special attacker can take care of Sandslash.</p>

<h1>Offensive Rapid Spin</h1>

<div class=set>
    Sandslash @ Lum Berry<br>
    Ability: Sand Rush<br>
    EVs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe<br>
    Adamant Nature<br>
    - Rapid Spin<br>- Knock Off<br>- Earthquake<br>- Swords Dance / Stealth Rock
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin is Sandslash's main move, enabling it to remove entry hazards. Knock Off is a great move on a dedicated Rapid Spin user like Sandslash, as it gives Sandslash some offensive presence and allows it to hit Ghost-types, which are immune to Rapid Spin; it also cripples every Pokemon in the tier that is reliant on its item. Earthquake is Sandslash's most powerful STAB move and, in combination with Knock Off, it allows Sandslash to KO spinblockers such as Golurk. Swords Dance boosts Sandslash's Attack by two stages and turns many 2HKOs into OHKOs, whereas Stealth Rock can be used over Swords Dance to support Sandslash's team.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Lum Berry is used to protect Sandslash from status once and help it deal with spinblockers, such as Gourgeist, that carry Will-O-Wisp. 84 Speed EVs allow Sandslash to outspeed everything up to uninvested base 75 Speed Pokemon out of sand, which include Garbodor and Seismitoad, and max base 120 Speed Pokemon, such as Sceptile, under sand support. Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature is for maximum power and also allows Sandslash to guarantee a 2HKO against Kangaskhan when unboosted, and an OHKO at +2. The rest of the EVs are put into HP for as much bulk as possible.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>A combination of Earthquake and Knock Off 2HKOes most of the spinblockers in the tier. Swords Dance turns 2HKOs into OHKOs, most importantly on Gourgeist after Stealth Rock damage, so use it carefully. It is best used on a predicted switch. Finally, if it is used, use Stealth Rock as early as possible as doing so pressures opposing Rapid Spin and Defog users and gets off chip damage on the opposing team.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Pokemon that appreciate Rapid Spin support, such as Archeops, Magmortar, Chatot, and Focus Sash users, love Sandslash. Sandslash has the most success on balanced and bulky offensive teams. Any team that is weak to types Sandslash resists, such as Rock- and Poison-type attacks, welcomes Sandslash, as does one that lacks a reliable Rapid Spin or Stealth Rock user. Sandslash really appreciates Pokemon that resist the common Water-, Grass-, and Ice-type attacks it is weak to as it would like to switch out safely. Finally, Spikes-stacking teams also appreciate what Sandslash brings to the table, as it uses Rapid Spin instead of Defog, which is counterproductive to such teams.</p>

<h1>Defensive Rapid Spin</h1>

<div class=set>
    Sandslash @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Sand Rush<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 232 Def / 20 Spe<br>
    Impish Nature<br>
    - Rapid Spin<br>- Earthquake<br>- Knock Off<br>- Stealth Rock / Toxic
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Rapid Spin gets rid of entry hazards so that Sandslash can support its teammates. Earthquake deals a significant amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it and 2HKOes almost every Pokemon weak to it. Knock Off is important, as it cripples opposing Pokemon by removing their item and hits bulky Ghost-types pretty hard even without any Attack investment. With its bulk, Sandslash can easily set up Stealth Rock, allowing it to support team members and get off chip damage on every opposing Pokemon that switches in. Alternatively, Toxic can also be used to cripple bulky Pokemon, such as Gourgeist.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Leftovers is used to give Sandslash some extra longevity, whereas Rocky Helmet can be used to punish physical threats such as Kangaskhan and Archeops, which Sandslash walls effectively. Maximum HP investment is used for maximum bulk. 20 Speed EVs allow Sandslash to outspeed everything up to uninvested base 67 Speed Pokemon, such as Lanturn. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense to allow Sandslash to take on physical threats much better, reducing the chances of Sandslash being OHKOed.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Sandslash's resistance to Stealth Rock makes it very easy for it to switch into Rapid Spin, especially when coming from a physical attacker. Rapid Spin is best used as soon as you see an opportunity to do so. If using Stealth Rock, make sure to set it up as early as possible to get off as much chip damage as possible. If using Toxic, it is best to preserve Sandslash to use Toxic on bulky Pokemon that could otherwise defeat its teammates.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Sandslash works best with Pokemon that need entry hazards removed to function well. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon, such as Archeops, Typhlosion, and Magmortar, work very well with Sandslash. Sandslash works best on balanced and bulky offensive teams, as Kabutops is often the better choice for heavy offensive teams. Sandslash appreciates Pokemon that resist its weaknesses to common attacking types, such as Water, Grass, and Ice; therefore, Fire- and Water-types, such as Pyroar and Ludicolo, work well with it. Finally, balanced Spikes-stacking teams work great with Sandslash, as it uses Rapid Spin instead of Defog, which is counterproductive on Spikes-stacking teams.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Life Orb Sandslash is one of the best Pokemon to have on a sand team and can function as a cleaner, but its Rapid Spin sets are more consistent and have better general utility. Counter can be used for its potential to OHKO any physical attacker trying to eliminate Sandslash. Super Fang can be used, as it can be really helpful by weakening opposing Pokemon, but it is very inconsistent. Finally, Rest can be used to heal Sandslash fully but requires that it either forgo Earthquake or Knock Off in exchange for Sleep Talk or run a Chesto Berry over Leftovers.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types, such as, Vileplume, Lilligant, and Leafeon can all wall Sandslash and either 2HKO or OHKO it, whereas Sandslash can do almost nothing back to them.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Defog Users</strong>: Though most Defog users are weak to Stealth Rock, Togetic and Vullaby are good answers to Sandslash, as both of them are immune to Earthquake, resist Knock Off, and can Defog away Stealth Rock, though neither of them appreciate losing their Eviolite. They can also 2HKO or 3HKO Sandslash depending on their EV spreads. Also, Togetic can set up with Nasty Plot and Baton Pass into another Pokemon. Additionally, Mantine, Pelipper, and Swanna are all Defog users who can OHKO Sandslash.</p>

<p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Seismitoad, Feraligatr, Samurott, and Ludicolo can all usually outspeed Sandslash and either 2HKO or OHKO it. Sandslash on the other hand, can not OHKO any of them.</p>

<p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Offensive Cryogonal, Rotom-F, Regice, and Aurorus can barely take an Earthquake or Knock Off, but they can OHKO back and are usually faster than Sandslash, making them shaky counters, but reliable checks.</p>

<p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers, such as Choice Specs Typhlosion and Life Orb Chatot, can OHKO Sandslash with ease; however, most of them can't take an Earthquake or Knock Off, rendering them as only checks.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>As Drizzle is banned to BL, Politoed struggles to find a niche in NU due to competition from the many other Water-types in the tier, especially Poliwrath. The one niche Politoed has to distinguish it from other bulky Water-types in the tier is access to the move Perish Song, which allows it to function well on stall teams. In most cases, Poliwrath is the better choice on your stall team, and Politoed should really only be used if you need a Pokemon that can take care of last Pokemon setup sweepers.</p>

<h1>Perish Song</h1>

<div class=set>
    Politoed @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Water Absorb<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD<br>
    Bold Nature<br>
    - Perish Song<br>- Scald<br>- Toxic<br>- Protect / Encore
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Perish Song is the only reason to use Politoed on a serious team. Perish Song prevents last-Pokemon sweepers such as Calm Mind Spiritomb and Calm Mind Slurpuff from running through a weakened stall team. Scald is a good STAB move on Politoed and has a 30% chance to burn the opponent. Toxic allows Politoed to beat setup sweepers such as Feraligatr, as well as status special attackers as they switch in. Protect allows Politoed to gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, stall out a turn of Perish Song, or deal extra damage to a statused Pokemon. Encore can also be used in this slot to take advantage of Pokemon trying to set up on Politoed.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Maximum HP and Defense investment along with a Bold nature allows Politoed to take on as many physical threats as possible. Leftovers is Politoed's only form of recovery, and Water Absorb allows it to take on opposing Water-types more easily. A specially defensive spread can be used if you are concerned about Pokemon such as specially based Samurott and Pyroar.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>It is important to conserve Politoed if your opponent has a Slurpuff or Spiritomb, as stall teams that lack Perish Song cannot deal with Calm Mind variants of these Pokemon. Spamming Scald early and often is a good way to cripple the opponent's physical attackers with burns; however, hitting special attackers with Toxic on the switch is much more valuable. Protect gives Politoed not only an extra turn of Leftovers recovery but also the ability to scout for Choice-locked moves. Once Protect is revealed, the opponent might attempt to set up on a predicted Protect, so it should be used more conservatively after that point.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Wish support is mandatory in order for Politoed to function properly. Audino is capable of supporting Politoed with not only Wish to heal Politoed's health but also Heal Bell to cure Politoed of any status ailments. Politoed also appreciates entry hazard support, which helps to wear down the opposing team when a Pokemon is forced to switch out due to Perish Song. Steelix provides Stealth Rock support for Politoed, while Politoed is capable of taking on the Water-types that threaten Steelix. Toxic Spikes support from the likes of Dragalge and Roselia, which both have good synergy with Politoed, is helpful to wear down physical attackers.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Politoed could use an offensive support set with Encore + 3 attacks, but it is outclassed by Samurott in this role. In fact, Politoed is outclassed by Samurott in any offensive role it attempts to perform. A bulky RestTalk set might seem appealing for its semi-reliable recovery, but if you are using a defensive set without Perish Song, Poliwrath is probably the better choice. Using Politoed to support its teammates with Rain Dance might seem like a good option, but Uxie and Liepard are much better rain setters than Politoed and don't have the bad synergy with Swift Swim sweepers that Politoed does.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Vileplume and Roselia can switch into Scald with ease, don't really care about getting burned, and, if they are part Poison-type, are immune to Toxic, all while threatening Politoed with their STAB moves. Roselia can set up Spikes on Politoed, while Vileplume can use Aromatherapy.</p>

<p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types threaten Politoed with their STAB moves, although most don't appreciate getting burned or hit by Toxic on the switch.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Status, especially Toxic, greatly shortens Politoed's life span and threatens to prevent it from using Perish Song late-game.</p>

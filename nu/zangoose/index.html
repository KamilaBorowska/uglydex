<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Zangoose is one of the most effective wallbreakers and late-game sweepers in the NU metagame. Zangoose also shines as one of the best possible sweepers for Sticky Web-based teams. After just a single turn needed to activate Toxic Boost, Zangoose has more initial power than most Pokemon in the tier. Its power can be bolstered further with Swords Dance, although Zangoose's poor bulk and lack of resistances makes it difficult for it to find a time to set up. This forces Zangoose to rely on double switches and pivoting moves in order to switch in safely. Despite Zangoose's excellent offensive moves in Facade, Knock Off, and Close Combat, Zangoose's base 90 Speed is merely above-average. Thankfully, Quick Attack and Sticky Web support can make up for this flaw, making Zangoose one of the top offensive threats in the tier.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>The power of Zangoose's primary STAB attack, Facade, doubles after Toxic Orb activates. Knock Off serves as solid coverage alongside Facade for hitting Ghost-types and is also useful for depriving almost any foe of its item. Quick Attack provides a way for Zangoose to dodge Sucker Punch from slower Pokemon, outspeed most other priority attackers, and pick off weakened or frail Pokemon that outspeed Zangoose. Close Combat is the preferred move for the last slot in order to allow Zangoose to break through the Rock- and Steel-types that can handle any of its other attacks. If you prefer using Zangoose as a wallbreaker, Swords Dance is a viable alternative to boost Zangoose's already high damage output to outstanding levels. Swords Dance is especially nice because one of the most common ways of handling Zangoose is trying to rack up Toxic damage against it with Protect and double switches, which can easily allow it a free turn to set up. Still, setting up can be difficult with Zangoose's poor bulk and lack of resistances. Using Close Combat allows Zangoose to sweep weakened teams more effectively thanks to its extra coverage against Rock- and Steel-types, reducing the need for such Pokemon to be significantly weakened. However, Swords Dance allows Zangoose to break through most physically defensive Pokemon more easily.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Toxic Orb is required to activate Toxic Boost; on the bright side, Toxic Orb only needs to activate once for Zangoose to gain the high power needed to sweep teams. Attack and Speed are fully invested into in order to maximize Zangoose's power, with an Adamant nature increasing that power further. A Jolly nature can alternatively be used to allow Zangoose to outspeed Adamant Kangaskhan and Jolly Sawk.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>As Toxic Orb places a time limit on Zangoose's longevity, proper timing when switching Zangoose into battle is vitally important when trying to use it effectively. Slow pivots, such as Probopass and Musharna, are the safest methods of activating Toxic Orb, as they can take damage from the opposing Pokemon and then Volt Switch or Baton Pass out instead of switching directly to Zangoose and forcing it to take unnecessary damage. Double switching is riskier, as it relies entirely on how well you predict your opponent's moves, but it yields the same results when correctly utilized. Zangoose can be effective during any phase of the battle, so try to activate Toxic Orb as soon as possible to make the most of its offensive potential. Sticky Web teams make excellent use of Zangoose, as it can outspeed many more Pokemon with Sticky Web support, including Choice Scarf Sawk if Zangoose uses a Jolly nature. Facade and Knock Off are generally the moves you will use most, as they are consistently powerful. You should use Close Combat and Quick Attack sparingly, as the former reduces Zangoose's already poor bulk while the latter is weak and only useful against faster opponents. As Zangoose is on a timer due to poison damage, you must try to predict your opponent's switches into Pokemon that have a resistance or immunity to one or more of Zangoose's attacks; Zangoose cannot afford any wasted turns. Zangoose generally will not have multiple opportunities to set up, so it is best to simply attack early in the game and save Swords Dance until you are sure Zangoose will not be forced out early.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Slow Pokemon with pivoting moves, namely Volt Switch, U-turn, Baton Pass, and Parting Shot, are excellent teammates for Zangoose, as they can take an attack before bringing Zangoose in and activating its Toxic Orb. Lanturn, Probopass, Pelipper, and Musharna are examples of such teammates. Probopass also has the benefit of being able to set up Stealth Rock, cripple faster Pokemon with Thunder Wave, and use its ability, Magnet Pull, to trap and weaken opposing Steel-type Pokemon to allow Zangoose to use Facade more freely. Entry hazard setters are very important for Zangoose, as it naturally forces many switches and needs to have a method to punish its opponent for switching too much. In addition, damage from Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes allows Zangoose to defeat Gurdurr with a combination of Facade and Quick Attack. Omastar and Crustle are great hazard leads that can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Mesprit can set up Stealth Rock and take on bulky Fighting-types, and Garbodor and Qwilfish can set up Spikes and easily switch into Fighting-type attacks.</p>

<p>As Zangoose is worn down quickly from entry hazard damage alongside Toxic damage, Rapid Spinners such as Sandslash and Cryogonal are helpful to minimize residual damage. Xatu can also keep hazards away from your side of the field and take on Fighting-types well. A check or counter to Gurdurr and other Fighting-types is required. Togetic, Mesprit, and Garbodor are some examples of Pokemon that can fulfill this role nicely. Dark-types, such as Liepard and Spiritomb, can trap faster Ghost-types with Pursuit and remove them so that Zangoose can use Facade safely. Teammates that appreciate Zangoose's ability to break down physically defensive Pokemon include Swellow, Feraligatr, Barbaracle, and Lilligant.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Protect can be used over Quick Attack, Close Combat, or Swords Dance for a guaranteed method of activating Toxic Orb, but giving up these moves is too costly, as Protect becomes nearly useless after Toxic Orb is activated. It can, however, also be used to dodge Fake Out from Kangaskhan. Pursuit can be used, as Zangoose forces many switches, but Zangoose would generally prefer the great power and utility of Knock Off. Taunt can stop defensive Pokemon from stalling for Toxic damage, but Zangoose would rather simply attack them. Low Kick is an alternative to Close Combat if you don't want to lower Zangoose's defenses, but the guaranteed power of Close Combat is preferable, and Zangoose is already frail. Counter can be used with a Focus Sash in order to catch physical attackers off-guard and take advantage of Zangoose's frailty, but this strategy is unreliable. A Choice Band set might seem viable, but Zangoose is just as powerful with Toxic Orb but with a stronger STAB and the ability to switch moves freely. Power-Up Punch can be used to boost Zangoose's power while still inflicting damage, but if Zangoose has the opportunity to attack with Power-Up Punch without being significantly damaged in return, it would be better off using Swords Dance instead most of the time.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Gurdurr</strong>: Gurdurr can withstand any move except a Swords Dance-boosted Facade and OHKO Zangoose with either Mach Punch or Drain Punch. However, with just a little bit of residual damage, Gurdurr is unable to switch into Facade without being picked off by a Quick Attack.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Residual damage from entry hazards stacks with Toxic damage and wears Zangoose down extremely quickly, severely limiting the amount of times it can switch in.</p>

<p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Zangoose is frail enough that priority moves can deal significant damage to it. Mach Punch can generally OHKO Zangoose, but Sucker Punch users must play around Quick Attack if they are naturally slower than Zangoose.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to everything Zangoose typically uses except Knock Off, giving them openings to switch in and stall out Toxic damage. Spiritomb takes neutral damage from Knock Off and can create mind games with Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Mismagius, Rotom, and Haunter are faster than Zangoose and are immune to grounded entry hazards such as Sticky Web.</p>

<p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: If Zangoose does not run Close Combat, most bulky Rock- and Steel-types such as Regirock, Probopass, Ferroseed, and Steelix can easily withstand any of Zangoose's attacks and retaliate.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Zangoose is extremely frail and is naturally worn down by Toxic damage, so any decently powerful Pokemon that outspeeds Zangoose can cripple it, if not outright OHKO it, though they should beware of Quick Attack.</p>

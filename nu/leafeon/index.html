<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Leafeon has great overall stats, notably its excellent Speed and high Attack stats, allowing it to be an effective Swords Dance sweeper. Leafeon checks threatening physical attackers such as Feraligatr and Kangaskhan thanks to its Grass typing and respectable Defense. Leafeon has access to the combination of STAB Leaf Blade and Knock Off for utility and coverage, allowing it to hit most of the tier for at least neutral damage. However, Leafeon is walled by common defensive Pokemon such as Vileplume and Weezing. Leafeon also has a very low Special Defense stat, leaving it weak to common special attackers such as Mesprit and Vivillon.</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Swords Dance boosts Leafeon's already high Attack stat to great levels, allowing it to punch holes in the opponent's team and possibly sweep. Leaf Blade is Leafeon's strongest STAB move, dealing huge amounts of damage to Pokemon that do not resist it. Knock Off provides great utility and coverage by hitting most Pokemon that resist Grass and weakening defensive Pokemon by removing their item. Synthesis allows Leafeon to regain health while setting up and after taking attacks such as Feraligatr's Ice Punch and Kangaskhan's Double-Edge. Alternatively, X-Scissor is an option to hit opposing Grass-types such as Tangela and Lilligant, for super effective damage. This is particularly helpful if Leafeon is paired with another sweeper that appreciates Tangela being weakened, such as Feraligatr. Baton Pass can be used to pass Swords Dance boosts to a teammate, but Leafeon is generally better off sweeping or punching holes on its own.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>The EV spread is straightforward for an offensive Pokemon, maximizing Leafeon's Attack and Speed. A Jolly nature is used over an Adamant one to capitalize on Leafeon's high Speed, allowing it to Speed tie with opposing base 95s, such as Primeape and Jynx, and outspeed threats such as Kangaskhan and Sawk. Life Orb greatly increases Leafeon's damage output, while a Lum Berry can be used to cure status once. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used for passive recovery throughout the battle in exchange for some loss of power.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Leafeon should set up a Swords Dance when it threatens and forces out a foe such as Rhydon or Seismitoad, as well as a weak defensive Pokemon such as Ferroseed. Leafeon should not set up until its checks and counters have been KOed or severely weakened. However, it may be useful in some situations to use Swords Dance early on to pressure the opponent and give Leafeon's teammates an easier time. Due to its good Grass typing and excellent Defense stat, Leafeon can also act as an effective pivot into many physical attackers, including Feraligatr and Kangaskhan. While Leafeon can switch into many physical attackers, it needs to be wary of U-turn from the likes of Primeape, Mesprit, and Liepard. Leafeon should utilize its above-average Speed to check Pokemon such as Kangaskhan throughout the battle.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Stealth Rock support from the likes of Seismitoad, Rhydon, and Probopass is helpful to wear down Leafeon's checks and counters. Forming a Fire / Water / Grass core is beneficial to cover Leafeon's various weaknesses. Good partners for this role include Seismitoad, Lanturn, Typhlosion, and Pyroar. Healing Wish support from Mesprit can be helpful to give Leafeon another chance at sweeping or punching holes into the opposing team. Teammates that share some checks and counters with Leafeon, such as Hariyama and Feraligatr, can help each other sweep. Both of these Pokemon have access to Ice Punch and Earthquake, which they can use to defeat Grass- and Poison-types that they lure in, such as Vileplume and Garbodor. Hariyama is also a good teammate because it resists Fire- and Ice-type attacks thanks to Thick Fat, but, it struggles with Flying-types. Rock-types, such as Rhydon and Probopass are good teammates to switch into Fire- and Flying-type attacks and provide Stealth Rock support. However, most Rock-types also have low Special Defense, which doesn't solve Leafeon's problems with special attackers.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Wish can be used on a physically defensive set to pass health to teammates, but Leafeon's low HP stat won't create very large Wishes. Quick Attack is a priority move, but it is very weak without a STAB boost. Double-Edge is another move that hits Pokemon that resist Grass for neutral damage, but its recoil combined with that of Life Orb makes it a sub-optimal choice. A bulky set with Substitute, Swords Dance, Leaf Blade, and Baton Pass allows Leafeon to support its teammates by passing Substitutes and Swords Dance boosts.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Many Ice-types, including Cryogonal, Rotom-F, and Jynx, can threaten to KO Leafeon with their STAB moves, but most cannot switch into Leafeon safely. However, if Jynx is not running a Choice Scarf, it risks Speed tying with Leafeon.</p>

<p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types, such as Pyroar and Typhlosion, can easily switch into Leafeon's Leaf Blade and threaten to KO Leafeon with their STAB moves. However, all Fire-types do not appreciate losing their item to a Knock Off.</p>

<p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Archeops, Vivillon, Rotom-S, and Scyther threaten Leafeon with their powerful STAB moves, but they must all be wary of Knock Off. Vivillon is, at its best, only a shaky check to Leafeon, as it relies on having its Focus Sash intact to KO Leafeon with Hurricane, so it will be greatly crippled by Knock Off. Rotom-S can burn Lum Berry-lacking Leafeon with Will-O-Wisp and threaten it with Air Slash. While Scyther does not appreciate losing its item to Knock Off, it can gain momentum with U-turn, heal off damage with Roost, or use Leafeon as Swords Dance bait.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types, such as Tangela and Vileplume, take minimal damage from Leafeon's STAB moves and can cripple it with a status move or hit back for super effective damage with Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Ice. However, Tangela must be wary of a boosted X-Scissor and does not appreciate losing its Eviolite to Knock Off.</p>

<p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types, such as Garbodor, Dragalage, and Weezing, take little damage from Leafeon's STAB and coverage moves and can hit back with a strong super effective attack. Many Poison-types can also use Leafeon as setup fodder for Spikes, Toxic Spikes, or both.</p>

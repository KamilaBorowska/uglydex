<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Audino is one of the premier special walls in the tier, as it has access to a number of support moves, including Wish, Protect, and Heal Bell. A fantastic ability in Regenerator means that Audino is a great Wish passer. Good all-around bulk allows Audino to take multiple hits. However, Audino's Normal typing isn't ideal for a wall because so many Pokemon carry Fighting-type coverage moves. With Audino's low attacking stats, bulky Pokemon are free to come in and potentially set up on Audino, caring little for any of the moves Audino can hit them with. Audino faces competition as a special wall, Wish passer, and Heal Bell user from Lickilicky. They are very similar, but Audino has Regenerator, which means that Audino has another way to heal itself besides Wish, so it does not need to heal itself with Wish as much.</p>

<h1>Wish Pass</h1>

<div class=set>
    Audino @ Leftovers<br>
    Ability: Regenerator<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD<br>
    Careful Nature<br>
    - Wish<br>- Protect<br>- Heal Bell / Encore<br>- Double-Edge / Knock Off
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Wish grants reliable recovery for both Audino and its teammates. Protect is to ensure Audino can heal without being hit. Protect is also good for scouting an opponent's moves and decisions. Heal Bell is used for removing the negative statuses of both teammates and Audino. Encore allows Audino to stop setup sweepers from coming in and setting up by locking them into a move such as Substitute or Swords Dance. Double-Edge is a powerful STAB move used for breaking Substitutes or getting chip damage on Pokemon, while Knock Off is a good utility move.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Max investment in both HP and Special Defense ensures that Audino takes the least possible amount of damage from special attacks. A Careful nature further boosts Special Defense. Leftovers are used for passive recovery.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Audino should switch in on special attackers. It can also be used as a pivot, coming in to see what a Pokemon wants to do and recovering HP by switching out with Regenerator. Use Wish and switch out to a teammate to pass the Wish and heal Audino's teammates. Protect should be used to scout Choice-locked moves.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Audino fits well on balance and stall teams. On balance teams it is used as a bulky pivot, providing Wish and Heal Bell support to sweepers, while on stall teams it is used as a glue, providing Wish support to Pokemon with only passive recovery and providing Heal Bell support to keep status away from Pokemon that are worn down easily through Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. Physical walls such as Gurdurr, Weezing, and Pelipper all complement Audino nicely as they can take Fighting-type moves and benefit from Audino's Wishes. On stall teams the aforementioned physical walls and entry hazard Pokemon such as Dragalge and Ferroseed like having Audino as a teammate. Sweepers in general all benefit from Audino's Wish and Heal Bell support.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Wish and Protect should be staples on any set Audino runs. However, other options for Audino include Thunder Wave to cripple offensive Pokemon, Yawn to force switches or put something to sleep, and Toxic to slowly wear down any switch-ins. Audino can also be used as a Trick Room setter. Alternatively, you can use Audino as a defensive wall with an Impish nature and 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def, but this isn't advisable as most Fighting-type moves are physical.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Hariyama, and Sawk can KO Audino with their STAB Fighting-type moves.</p>

<p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt shuts down Audino's support options, as it blocks Wish, Protect, and Heal Bell.</p>

<p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers can come in on Audino and set up at no cost unless Audino is carrying Encore.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic and Will-O-Wisp cripple Audino, and the passive difference can mean the difference between Audino being knocked out and Audino recovering health with Wish.</p>

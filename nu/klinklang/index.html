<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Klinklang was gifted with the unique move Shift Gear, allowing it to boost its Speed by two stages and its Attack by one stage. On top of that, it is naturally bulky, allowing it to take a hit or two and set up. Its pure Steel typing allows it to resist common attacking types, most notably Psychic, Grass, and Fairy. However, its stats are altogether mediocre. Its lacking movepool leaves it wanting for coverage, and its susceptibility to status leaves it vulnerable to burns and paralysis. Its typing also leaves it susceptible to all the common Fire- and Fighting-types in the tier.</p>

<h1>Shift Gear</h1>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Shift Gear boosts Attack and Speed, allowing Klinklang to take down threats it isn't able to before setting up. Gear Grind is its strongest STAB attack, hitting opposing Pokemon twice. This means it can damage past Substitutes or OHKO Focus Sash or Sturdy Pokemon. Return is a powerful move that can hit Pokemon Gear Grind doesn't without fear of recoil. Substitute can be used to avoid status, as any status move will severely hamper Klinklang's sweep. Wild Charge hits Water-type Pokemon hard, but at the cost of significant recoil damage.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Max Attack investment helps Klinklang be the most potent threat possible. Adamant simply increases the Attack boost from Shift Gear. 120 Speed EVs are enough to outspeed Choice Scarf base 100 Pokemon, most notably Typhlosion after a Shift Gear boost, allowing for more investment in HP. An alternate EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe can be used to outspeed Adamant Sawk before boosts. Clear Body ensures that Intimidate users such as Mawile can't switch in and lower Klinklang's Attack and also lets it avoid Sticky Web Speed drops. Leftovers allows Klinklang to survive a few more hits and gives it some means of recovery, mitigating the damage it takes during setup and the recoil of Wild Charge. Alternatively, Lum Berry can be used to avoid status, which means Substitute doesn't need to be used, leaving a moveslot open for Wild Charge.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Be sure that any Pokemon that would wall Klinklang such as Seismitoad or Quagsire are taken out, especially if setting up is going to be a dangerous task. Bring Klinklang in when it will force out the opposing Pokemon. Use Shift Gear to boost Klinklang's damage output; from there, simply choose the most powerful coverage move at hand. Gear Grind is almost always the most powerful option. Just be sure to note when Gear Grind will be a resisted hit or when another move will be super effective.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Granbull is able to effectively switch into Fighting-types, and Mesprit is also able to take them down. Vileplume easily takes down Seismitoad and the other bulky Water-types that Klinklang needs out of the way. Klinklang fits well on a Fire-type attack spamming team, as these attacks get rid of the Steel-types that wall it. Klinklang by itself is capable of dealing a lot of damage, but it often can't OHKO full-health Pokemon. As such, it appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Garbodor and Crustle.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Life Orb means more damage, but it also means that Klinklang will take Wild Charge recoil in addition to Life Orb recoil. Life Orb Hidden Power Grass can be used to take out Seismitoad and Quagsire. Volt Switch is also an interesting option for pivoting out of dangerous situations.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Both Gurdurr and Hariyama are able to easily take a +1 Gear Grind and nail Klinklang with a STAB Drain Punch or Close Combat.</p>

<p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Seismitoad resists Gear Grind, is immune to Wild Charge, and takes little from Return. It can easily 2HKO with its Ground-type STAB attacks. Pelipper and Mantine threaten Klinklang with a Scald burn and only fear the occasional Wild Charge. In addition, Mantine can remove Klinklang's boosts with Haze. Quagsire's Unaware ignores Klinklangs boosts and it can hit back hard with a STAB Earthquake or set up Curse boosts. </p>

<p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Any Pokemon that resists Gear Grind and has a high enough Defense will easily wall Klinklang. Stunfisk can take any of Klinklang's hits and power through it with Earth Power. Pelipper walls Klinklang if it lacks Wild Charge and threatens it with Scald.</p>

<p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Weezing can survive any of Klinklang's attacks and can couter with a Flamethrower or cripple it with a Will-O-Wisp. </p>

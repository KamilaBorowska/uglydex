<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Rotom-W is a great glue Pokemon in the metagame. Its outstanding defensive typing with Levitate leaves it with just a single weakness and several resistances to common attacking types. This allows Rotom-W to be a fantastic check to top-tier threats such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Landorus-T. Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are great assets, as both can cripple giant portions of the metagame. Unfortunately for Rotom-W, its HP and Speed stats are rather lackluster, and faster wallbreakers, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Latios, can easily break through it. Its offensive coverage is also walled by most Grass- and Dragon-types.</p>

<h1>Special Tank</h1>

<div class=set>
    Rotom-Wash @ Sitrus Berry<br>

    EVs: 252 HP / 116 Def / 100 SpA / 40 SpD<br>
    Modest Nature<br>
    - Hydro Pump<br>- Thunderbolt<br>- Will-O-Wisp / Thunder Wave<br>- Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>This is by far Rotom-W's most consistent set, doing an amazing job at checking or countering various threats in DOU. Hydro Pump is a solid STAB move that allows Rotom-W to score OHKOs on Landorus-T, Mega Diancie, and offensive variants of Heatran. Thunderbolt is usually used to hit Water-types that resist Hydro Pump as well as Pokemon which take roughly equal damage from both attacks, as it is also more reliable than Hydro Pump due to its better accuracy. Will-O-Wisp is a great way to deal with physical attackers, allowing Rotom-W to check Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Metagross among others. It also gives Rotom-W a way to punish its most common switch-in, Amoonguss. However, Thunder Wave is great speed control, and especially important if you plan to use Rotom-W as a rain check, since it survives Ludicolo's Giga Drain and can paralyze it back. Protect keeps Rotom-W alive, stalls field conditions, and scouts for attacks.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>With this EV spread, Rotom-W always survives two Mega Diancie Diamond Storms and survives two Amoonguss Giga Drains 99.6% of the time. If you're using Rotom-W on a Tailwind team, you should move 12 Special Attack EVs to Speed to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T in Tailwind. Sitrus Berry is by far the most consistent item option for Rotom-W, but ChestoRest is another option for greater healing, though at the risk of not running Protect.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>Rotom-W should be played as a bulky offensive glue Pokemon. This means that it should be switching into opposing threats, usually Water-, Flying-, or Ground-types, and either dealing damage or spreading status. Thanks to its amazing typing, it does this fairly reliably. Rotom-W also does a great job of tanking SlideQuake, which is a very popular coverage combination on Ground-types. The only Pokemon you should really fear with Rotom-W out are Grass- and Dragon-types. Threats with Lum Berry, such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp, like to lure Rotom-W and hit really hard. Make sure Rotom-W stays alive if the opponent is holding back Talonflame or Heatran, because they can be really threatening late-game if Rotom-W is taken out.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Charizard are arguably the best partners to Rotom-W, as they benefit from having a partner that can sponge threatening Ground- and Rock-type attacks, and they can take out the Grass-types that threaten Rotom-W. Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Mega Lucario, Heatran, and Aegislash complement Rotom-W well defensively, as they resist Dragon- and Grass-type attacks, and Rotom-W resists Fire-type attacks. Ground-types appreciate Rotom-W as a partner, as they can freely use Earthquake beside it. Mamoswine is especially relevant here, as it can snipe Dragon- and Grass-types with ease.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Rotom-W can run Electroweb alongside Will-O-Wisp to offer both speed control and burn support, and with 56 Speed EVs, it can outspeed -1 Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y. However, outside of that, Thunder Wave is the more consistent option. Light Screen is an option if Rotom-W's team is weaker on the specially defensive side. Assault Vest could work with Electroweb or Volt Switch, but Rotom-W will miss Sitrus Berry's recovery and the utility of its status attacks. Choice Specs Rotom-W can deal surprising damage to some switch-ins. Using a Choice Scarf allows it to outrun threats that would stay in against it, such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Gyarados, as well as standard Choice Scarf Landorus-T if Rotom-W runs a Timid nature. With Choice sets, Rotom-W can also use Trick, which is an outstanding countermeasure against Trick Room teams.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Offensive Typing Advantage</strong>: Lum Berry Ferrothorn is a fantastic answer to Rotom-W as it shrugs off every attack Rotom-W offers. Amoonguss is also a major pain because it redirects and tanks everything Rotom-W uses. Other Grass-types, such as Venusaur and Shaymin-S, can outspeed Rotom-W and threaten it with their STAB moves, but they must avoid switching in on Thunder Wave. Dragon-types such as Latios, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon also beat Rotom-W, but they must be wary of Thunder Wave. Excadrill and Mega Gyarados deserve special mentions because they can bypass Levitate with Mold Breaker and strike Rotom-W with super effective Earthquakes.</p>

<p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Several Pokemon can strike through Rotom-W's average defenses and deal huge damage with their STAB attacks. Mega Kangaskhan, Deoxys-A, Terrakion, and Mega Heracross can KO it with their STAB attacks after only a little prior damage, but they must find a way to switch in safely. Guts Conkeldurr benefits from status conditions, can tank Rotom-W's attacks, and threatens it with Drain Punch.</p>

<p><strong>Utility Moves</strong>: Taunt users such as Thundurus and Sableye can stop Rotom-W from supporting its team with status. Substitute users with decent bulk or resistances to its attacks, such as Kyurem-B, make excellent counters as well.</p>

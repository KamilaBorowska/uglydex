</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<ul>
<li>Is the premier Sand setter for Doubles, making it useful against Pokemon like Charizard-Y</li>
<li>High Attack, access to great spread move in Rock Slide, and sweet ability make it pretty awesome. The Special Defense boost from Sand also serves as a nice compliment to its natural bulk</li>
<li>Also, it's a versatile Pokemon (can run a special set, Choice Scarf set, and Dragon Dance set in addition to the one listed)</li>
<li>Sadly, it's weak to many common attacking types such as Water, Ground, and Fighting</li>
<li>The prevalence of Intimidate and moves that cause burns also makes life hard for Tyranitar, as both of those hurt its offensive presence.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Bulky Attacker</h1>

<div class=set>
    Tyranitar @ Chople Berry / Passho Berry<br>
    Ability: Sand Stream<br>
    EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD<br>
    Adamant / Brave Nature<br>
    - Rock Slide<br>- Crunch<br>- Low Kick<br>- Protect
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rock Slide is the main move and is cool since it's a spread move (meaning it hits both opponents at once), is STAB, and has a nifty 30% flinch chance</li>
<li>Crunch is a second STAB move, has good coverage w/ Rock Slide and does more damage to a single target than Rock Slide</li>
<li>Low Kick is great for Heatran and opposing Tyranitar</li>
<li>Protect shields you from damage when needed, and is especially important due to the many common weaknesses Tyranitar possesses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<ul>
<li>The EV spread is simple and is meant to make it as bulky and powerful as possible</li>
<li>Chople Berry is due to Tyranitar's huge Fighting-type weakness</li>
<li>If you'd rather give it a better chance against Water types a Passho Berry could be used</li>
<li>Lum Berry could work to heal off burns</li>
<li>Adamant is the preferred nature for as much power as possible</li>
<li>If using Trick room, you may want to consider a Brave nature to lower Tyranitar's Speed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be wary of Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp such as Rotom-W, as they can cripple Tyranitar with a burn</li>
<li>Using this when you see potential Trick Room setters can be a good idea, as Tyranitar is able to threaten most Trick Room setters with its powerful Crunch</li>
<li>Play this carefully when you see weather based teams, as stripping an opposing team of their preferred weather can be very detrimental to them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Rotom-W work well here since they have good defensive synergy with Tyranitar</li>
<li>Pokemon that can switch in on Fighting-type attacks such as Cresselia could also be good partners.</li>
<li>Mega Garchomp or Excadrill could be potential partners to take advantage of Tyranitar's Sand Stream.</li>
<li>Hitmontop works well as a partner due to having Wide Guard, shielding Tyranitar from Muddy Water, Earthquake, Dazzling Gleam, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<ul>
<li>Choice Scarf</li>
<li>Special Attacker</li>
<li>Dragon Dance</li>
<li>Iron Ball with Trick Room support</li>
<li>Stone Edge to get around Wide Guard</li>
</ul>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<ul>
<li>Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr, Hitmontop, and Scrafty can switch into Tyranitar easily and take it out. Hitmontop and Scrafty also have Intimidate, which lowers the effectiveness of physical sets even further.</li>
<li>Landorus-T has Intimidate and can deal a lot of damage with Earthquake. Excadrill and Mega Garchomp also have powerful Earthquakes and can take advantage of Tyranitar's Sand to wreak havoc.</li>
<li>Rotom-W can hit Tyranitar with a powerful Hydro Pump or just cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Other bulky Water-types such as Suicune can tank an attack comfortably and hit back super effectively (potentially scoring a burn if they have Scald)</li>
<li>Scizor can outspeed it and use Bug Bite, or pick it off with Bullet Punch. Genesect has powerful Bug-type attacks that will take a chunk out of Tyranitar's health.</li>
<li>Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon will do large amounts of damage with their super effective STAB</li>
<li>Any other Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp can render physical Tyranitar much less threatening</li>
</ul>

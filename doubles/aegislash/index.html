<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Aegislash's unique Steel / Ghost typing allows it to check many common threats in Doubles, such as Fairy-types, Dragon-types, Mega Kangaskhan, Cresselia, Hitmontop, and Terrakion. In addition, thanks to Stance Change, it can switch between dual 150 offensive stats and great 60 / 150 / 150 defensive stats with King's Shield. This allows Aegislash to act as an offensive pivot that uses its great bulk and typing to switch into many common Doubles attackers while threatening them with its ability to attack both physically and specially with strong, reliable STAB attacks. Aegislash's movepool is also very effective, allowing it to pull off a dynamic offensive set or support its teammates with Wide Guard. Aegislash's low Speed is a blessing, allowing it to always tank a hit in its Shield forme and then attack in its Blade forme; it also lets Aegislash reliably check Trick Room teams, threatening most setters with super effective coverage. However, Aegislash's biggest problems in Doubles are the prevalence of Fire- and Ground-type attackers in the metagame and the lack of recovery moves in its movepool, which limits its longevity.</p>

<h1>Wide Guard Tank</h1>

<div class=set>
    Aegislash @ Sitrus Berry / Lum Berry<br>

    EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD<br>
    Quiet Nature<br>
    - Wide Guard<br>- Shadow Ball<br>- Flash Cannon<br>- King's Shield
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Wide Guard is an excellent support move in Doubles because spread attacks are extremely common. Aegislash is weak to some common spread attacks itself, such as Heat Wave and Earthquake, so both Aegislash and its partner can easily take advantage of its utility. In addition, Aegislash's STAB attacks have great coverage together. Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon both have decent Base Power and reliable accuracy, threatening almost the entire metagame with consistent damage. It's also notable that almost every Trick Room setter is weak to one of Aegislash's STAB attacks, making it a great lead against Trick Room teams. Lastly, King's Shield protects it from enemy attacks and reverts Blade forme Aegislash back into Shield forme allowing it to utilize both formes' offensive and defensive capabilities; the potential Attack drop with King's Shield is an added bonus that allows Aegislash to check most physical attackers. The only downside of using King's Shield instead of Protect is the vulnerability to status attacks.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Aegislash's Speed is minimized with a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs to ensure that it tanks both of its opponent's attacks in Shield forme before switching to Blade forme. It also allows Aegislash to reliably check Trick Room teams. Sitrus Berry grants it decent longevity because it utilizes Aegislash's great bulk to turn many 2HKOs into 3HKOs. However, a Lum Berry also works well, patching up King's Shield's vulnerability to status attacks.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>This set is used best as a pivot, utilizing Aegislash's great typing and bulk in Shield forme to switch into many common threats in Doubles. It is common for Aegislash to lead against Trick Room teams due to its specific offensive coverage against the Ghost- and Fairy-types that commonly set it up. If Trick Room does get set up, Aegislash has a field day outspeeding and denting many Pokemon in the metagame. Wide Guard should be used when the opponent has an obvious Earthquake, Heat Wave, etc. to protect both itself and its partner from attacks, allowing Aegislash's partner to attack an enemy Pokemon or set up with little to fear. If Wide Guard support isn't necessary, then Aegislash should focus on firing off strong STAB attacks to deal key damage to its opponents. Aegislash should typically rotate between an attack and King's Shield so it never has to take an attack in its frail Blade forme. King's Shield also acts as makeshift Attack control, checking any physical sweeper with attacks that make contact. However, it is common for threats to set up boosting moves or Substitute on predicted King's Shields, so overusage can undermine Aegislash's defensive capabilities.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>First and foremost, anything that appreciates Wide Guard support makes a great partner for this set. This includes Mega Pinsir (which is weak to Heat Wave), Heatran (which is weak to Earthquake), Mega Charizard Y (which is weak to Rock Slide), and much more. Synergy wise, Terrakion beats the Dark- and Fire-types that threaten Aegislash, while it covers Terrakion's Fairy-, Fighting-, and Steel-type weaknesses in return. While Aegislash does block Heat Wave and Earthquake, it has no way to beat their users offensively. So, partners that beat users of these moves, such as Water-types, pair well with it. Because Aegislash functions well in Trick Room, partners such as Aromatisse, Chandelure, and Jellicent can help set it up.</p>

<h1>Offensive Pivot</h1>

<div class=set>
    Aegislash @ Leftovers / Weakness Policy<br>

    EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpA<br>
    Quiet Nature<br>
    - Shadow Ball<br>- Flash Cannon<br>- Substitute / Shadow Sneak / Sacred Sword<br>- King's Shield
</div>

<h2>Moves</h2>

<p>Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon are Aegislash's primary attacks because they have good neutral coverage against almost the entire metagame, decent Base Power, and reliable accuracy. Substitute can be used in the third slot to take advantage of the switches Aegislash causes, allowing it to spam its great and powerful coverage moves with little to fear. In addition, Substitute compensates for King's Shield's inability to block status moves. Shadow Sneak allows Aegislash to pick off threats with low HP without having to take an attack beforehand. After a Weakness Policy boost, Shadow Sneak can pick off an even larger set of weakened threats, keeping offensive momentum on Aegislash's side. However, Sacred Sword is a good option instead of Shadow Sneak because it hits Bisharp, which hard-counters this set otherwise, for great damage. It also hits threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Assault Vest Scrafty harder. Lastly, King's Shield is a must for this set because it reverts Aegislash back to its Shield forme, which allows Aegislash to take super effective hits safely, activating Weakness Policy. It also protects Aegislash from offensive strategies, stalls field conditions, and scouts for super effective coverage.</p>

<h2>Set Details</h2>

<p>Offensive Aegislash has two items that it can utilize well in Doubles: Leftovers and Weakness Policy. The first useable combination for Aegislash is Leftovers with Substitute, which drastically increases its longevity, allowing it to fire off many more decently powered attacks. However, Weakness Policy takes advantage of Shield forme Aegislash's outstanding bulk; it can tank a super effective hit it lures and deal massive damage back with a +2 attack. Weakness Policy works best with Shadow Sneak or Sacred Sword in the third moveslot, so Aegislash is able to cover many threats while attacking. The Weakness Policy set also really appreciates Trick Room, so Aegislash can outspeed and demolish many threats; Quiet Nature and 0 Speed IVs is used for this reason.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<p>If Aegislash is using Weakness Policy, it should focus on finding the right super effective attack to take in its Shield forme. Aegislash can survive almost any super effective attack in Doubles, but optimally, it should try to take a non-STAB super effective attack, such as a stray Knock Off or Earthquake used as coverage, so it still has enough bulk to maintain a long sweep. After a boost, Aegislash should spam its STAB attacks, KOing many threats with its neutral coverage. It is still wise to rotate between attacking and King's Shield so it can take more attacks. If a partner has set up Trick Room, Aegislash can have a field day outspeeding and smacking anything it wants. Shadow Sneak allows it to function very well even outside of Trick Room, taking out Pokemon that might have survived one of its STAB attacks. If Aegislash is using Leftovers, then it should focus on switching in on the many attackers it walls, setting up Substitute if advantageous, and spamming its STAB attacks. Rotating between Substitute and King's Shield goes a long way towards improving Aegislash's longevity, allowing it to stall out many field conditions and racking up Leftovers recovery.</p>

<h2>Team Options</h2>

<p>Offensive Aegislash requires more specific team support than the Wide Guard set. Trick Room support is highly encouraged, especially if it is using Weakness Policy; good partners to set it up are Aromatisse, Chandelure, and Slowking, which check Aegislash's Dark-, Fire-, and Ground-type weaknesses, respectively. Landorus-T, Suicune, Politoed, and Gyarados are all good partners to threaten the common Earthquake and Heat Wave users that run over Aegislash. Dark-types such as Assault Vest Scrafty and Tyranitar pair well with it and cover its Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses. If Aegislash isn't using Sacred Sword, Mach Punch partners such as Conkeldurr and Breloom are recommended to handle Bisharp reliably. Helping Hand support allows Aegislash to deal significant damage, which can be crucial if Aegislash doesn't have a boost or needs to snipe a healthier threat with Shadow Sneak. Lastly, Follow Me / Rage Powder support lets Aegislash safely fire off attacks or set up Substitute with greater ease.</p>

<h1>Other Options</h1>

<p>Aegislash can use a Spooky Plate or a Life Orb to boost its attacks, which will provide a more consistent but less effective performance. It could also potentially run a fully physical set using Swords Dance, Gyro Ball, Shadow Claw, and/or Shadow Sneak, but the abundance of Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate makes it an underwhelming option. Reflect is an option to support the team with Defense boost. Autotomize is an option to boost Aegislash's Speed to great levels, but it is difficult to set up in Doubles. Safety Goggles can work well, as thye help Aegislash more easily counter Grass-types that run sleeping moves. Under Trick Room, Aegislash can use Rock Slide to check Mega Charizard Y, a major threat to it. An Air Balloon or Shuca Berry can be held to switch into or lure Ground-types, respectively. Hidden Power Ice hits threats such as Landorus-T, Salamence, and Shaymin-S for massive damage. Lastly, Aegislash can use ChestoRest for the most reliable form of recovery.</p>

<h1>Checks &amp; Counters</h1>

<p><strong>Offensive Typing Advantage</strong>: Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill threaten Aegislash with STAB Earthquake, forcing it to repeatedly use Wide Guard or switch out. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran do the same; Aegislash must repeatedly block Heat Wave, and if its partner can't touch those threats, Aegislash will lose the match-up. Ghost- and Dark-types such as Mega Gengar and Scrafty can threaten Aegislash super effectively with their STAB attacks as well, but they must tread carefully around its coverage. Dark-types stand the best chance due to their resistance to Shadow Ball. Bisharp resists both STAB moves and isn't affected by King's Shield's Attack drop, only worrying about Sacred Sword, making it a reliable check. Remember, if any of these threats misses out on the KO, there is the possibility that Aegislash will just hit back with a Weakness Policy-boosted Attack.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Due to King's Shield's inability to block status attacks, it is easy to target this vulnerability. Breloom and Amoonguss can reliably put Aegislash to sleep with Spore while it is blocking the sleeper's partner's attack. Thunder Wave users such as Thundurus, Togekiss, and Klefki can also cripple it, hindering Aegislash's ability to support or sweep the team.</p>

<p><strong>Utility</strong>: Taunt is a great method for checking Aegislash, because it prevents Aegislash from reverting back to its Shield forme, exposing the Blade forme's pitiful bulk. Taunt also stops Aegislash from using Wide Guard or Substitute; good users of it include Thundurus and Sableye. Encore works as well, hindering Aegislash by locking it into one of these moves; Whimsicott, Togekiss, and Politoed are common users of this move. Another way to check Aegislash is using the item Assault Vest. Pokemon such as Scrafty, Goodra, and Ludicolo can check it easily with their increased bulk.</p>
